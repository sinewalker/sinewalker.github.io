&lt;!--more--&gt;So, now I'll run both counters for a little while to see how they compare.  There's fuller stats on the new one.  I set it to start at 1415 (the value of the old counter when I looked just now).



The new counter distinguishes between page loads and visits by using a cookie in your browser.  The cookie resets after 6 hours.  So if you visit the site twice or more within 6 hours, you are only counted once.



Eventually I'll probably remove the WordPress counter.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MJL2006-07-19T12:20+1000 — Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I just found where to set a cookie to stop StatCounter counting my own visits — statistics are currently heavily skewed to a certain visitor from Michigan with a dynamic IP address. Michigan is where my work's Internet access eventually pops out, so it's probably just me…  With the cookie set in my browser, hopefully this will stop it recording my own visits and then the stats will get more interesting.Apart from this, the stats already show that I have about 20 unique visitors.  Hi guys!  Now I know people actually read this stuff, I might have to think about putting &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; notes up here, rather than just the notes I keep for my own reference.



&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MJL2006-08-01T16:00+1000 — Update:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it seems the new counter's stats are much more conservative, so I trust them more than the stock WordPress counter.  I've removed the WordPress counter.</description><category>blog</category><category>general</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/07/14/stat-counter.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2006 05:16:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Are Blog Stats valid?</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/06/01/are-blog-stats-valid.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I just passed 500 hits.  Now, many of the first couple of hundred are just me browsing without being logged in (this is my home page, and the cookies weren't being kept for a while there…).


The number goes up by about 10–15 a day, but I didn't think I had anyone reading this?  Surely it's not being hit by Google and friends that often, is it?

&lt;hr&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, here is the new Wordpress version of my blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
So far, I'm pretty impressed with Wordpress.  The code is much cleaner than
Blogger, its post editor is far superior too.  I love the Categories, they work
much easier than the Blogger + Delicious kludge I had at &lt;a title="My old blog
                                                                   site" href="http://sinewalker.blogspot.com"&gt;my
    old blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;



&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard templates mostly have the same issue as Blogger — they are fixed-width columns for the most part.  I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; that!  I'll have to figure out how to change templates here too (or, migrate from the Wordpress.com hosting site to my ISP's hosting site, which I may yet do…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In the mean-time, I'll stick with one of the standard templates. This template I've found at least is variable-width — so the blog takes up all of your browser's window width — but I'm not keen on the white background. Oh well, it'll do until I get my own wordpress running.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Wordpress</category><category>blog</category><category>general</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/03/30/migrated-to-wordpress.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Mar 2006 01:15:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>??

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New del.icio.us rolls do not appear at right-hand side of this site, even though they did in Preview?  Strange.  Maybe it's a blogger glitch?  See what happens in a few days, I suppose...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;:  2006-03-20 12:45 -- Not a glitch. Strange behaviour when I commented the del.icio.us block in the template.  It seems that the comment block wasn't terminated?  Odd.  Fixed by removing my comments.  This is sub-optimal, but works at least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've added the new “tag roll” and “link roll” to the right in
      this blog's template.  Looks great, but examining my tags reveals I'm a
      bit disorganised, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's nothing, you should check out my tags in Flickr.  Definitely could do with some improvement there.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/help/tags"&gt;Tags&lt;/a&gt; are a great idea.  The trouble is, I'm uncertain how best to use them.
That is, what are the best tag words to attach to a link or photo so that I can
find the right one again? How can I best group my del.icio.us tags
into &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/help/bundles"&gt;Bundles &lt;/a&gt;to facilitate
research? Should I even try?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I guess only experience will help. So I'll keep persevering :-).  Also, since tags are social, looking at how other people have tagged their stuff could be instructive too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Delicious</category><category>blog</category><category>general</category><category>tagging</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/03/20/organising-my-bookmarks.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 20 Mar 2006 01:16:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
