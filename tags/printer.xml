&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here's a first for me:  go to local Dick Smith's, buy a
      cheap printer, for my wife  (HP Deskjet 3940, AU$66).  Because I don't
      really care about printing from Linux, I didn't care if it works or not
      on that OS, just bought whatever Windows printer was cheapest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Brought it home, plugged it into my PC (in Windows) and it works, after installing drivers and software and about 15 mins of setup time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
For the heck of it, I rebooted to Linux to see what would happen.  Well lordy
“New hardware detected:  HPdeskjet3940” and an offer to set it up. After 5
minutes — just accepting all the standard options — out comes a test page, in
colour, bi-directional and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Neat.  Linux is ready for me....&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hacking</category><category>hardware</category><category>linux</category><category>printer</category><category>useability</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/03/22/new-printer-just-works-in-suse-10.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2006 22:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
