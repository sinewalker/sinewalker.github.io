&lt;p&gt;After using contacts in her phone to try and get some help from friends or family (no one of either category) or neighbors (no answers), I decided to take her home as she said she only lived about a block away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I and another woman bystander helped her home (we used the other woman's car around the corner to get there) and I took her up her steps. Then into the home (she couldn't use keys, took her three goes to find the right set...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She slumped to the floor, slipped over backwards just like my little bub does. So, I propped her up with a cushion.  I made sure she was okay to look after herself, got her a glass of water. She seemed only drunk, not stoned (not that I have a lot of experience there...). Left her alone to sober up and sleep it off. As I left she insisted on a hug.  I guess she's okay ? She lives alone with cats, said she'd been drinking vodka, and that she had to go to a job interview (!?) I'm guessing that's why she was out in the street dressed up in a suit jacket. Very sad. Then I missed my train and got home late. So a bit of a downer, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever feel stressed and lonely and try to get some "Dutch courage" before a job interview through drink, please rethink it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>depression</category><category>mental health</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2011/sad-lonely-woman.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2011 12:11:33 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
