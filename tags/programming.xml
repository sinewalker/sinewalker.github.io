I braved the contempt of my friends last week and ventured out to see

"Bambi", the Disney rerelease that is proving to be a hit once again in the

box office. I was looking forward to a gentle, soothing, late afternoon

relief from the Washington Summer. Instead I was traumatized. As a

sense of security and comfort. Birds twitter; small rabbits turn out to be

great conversationalists. Pop is what Senator Moynihan would describe as an

absent father, but Mom's there to make you feel OK in the odd thunderstorm.

You make great friends, fool around on the ice, discover the meadow,

generally mellow out. Then, without any particular warning, your mom gets

shot, your voice breaks, huge growths start appearing on your head, and

your peers start heading off into the clover with the apparent intention of

having sex. Next thing you know, the forest burns down. If I were still

eight, I think I'd prefer _Rambo III_."

In regards to Oral Roberts' claim that God told him that he would die

done it a long time ago.'

When I was young, my family bought a color TV. Our neigbors, who were

poorer, had only a black-and-white set. They bought a piece of cellophane,

ARPAnet, CSnet, BITnet and USEnet are fellow travellers of a

brotherhood which has no name or formal organization. You can easily

  posted &lt;a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=184329&amp;amp;cid=15234982"&gt;this
    reply &lt;/a&gt;to an Ask
  Slashdot:  &lt;a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/28/2236239"&gt;Do
    Kids still program?&lt;/a&gt; I found myself commenting all over that thread… it
  must be close to my heart :-) Reproducing here, and exploring a little
  further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
Many of the observations made on Slashdot are right. I wonder what it is that
drives me to hack, that is missing from what is covered? Why do I like to hack,
and why would it be passed over by kids these days? Or would it?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, when all that my computer would do when I turned it on was
blink a cursor and answer
“&lt;a href="http://www.cpc-emu.org/firststeps.html"&gt;Syntax error&lt;/a&gt;” to
everything I typed, why didn't I just get bored and do something fun, like read
a good book, watch TV, or go outside and play? Why was I still motivated to
program instead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think that the answer is: &lt;strong&gt;I was fascinated by
the &lt;em&gt;puzzle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I was also keenly interested in figuring out how
things work. I used to pull clocks apart, build electronic toys, re-wire
stereos, that sort of thing: a computer is just another gadget to
tweak. Although, because it was very very expensive (about AU$3500 for a Z-80
based 8-bit micro in 1986!) I'd better figure out how it works by “programming”
it—whatever that is—rather than by taking it apart.  I was encouraged in this
because the book that came with the computer says “you can't break your
computer by programming it”… (The book I refer to the is very
good &lt;a title="Online archive copy of the Amstrad CPC 6128 manual." href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/manuals/AmstradCPC6128-hypertext-en-Sinewalker.pdf"&gt;introductory
manual&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a title="Some basic info in this 8-bit home micro" href="http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/6128"&gt;CPC-6128&lt;/a&gt;, published by Amstrad
Computer in 1985; I've not found one to better it yet, see especially Ch 2, 6
and 8)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If computers present a puzzle that is interesting, has a low entry barrier, and
rewards exploration, then kids will program it. Other posts in this thread show
that: the puzzle isn't interesting if the computer does nearly everything you
want anyway, the entry barrier is very high (hidden or non-existent programming
tools) and the reward for exploration is quite low (results gained through
programming lower than you get from an Internet search, most of the time).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It's sad. I have a very young son who (if he's interested later—he's only 6
months old now :-D ) I'd &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to share my love of programming
with. But in light of how
“&lt;a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=184329&amp;amp;cid=15234943"&gt;kids
these days&lt;/a&gt;” view computers, I'm having a hard time coming up with
interesting puzzles that are easy to get started in and reward
exploration. &lt;a href="http://www.squeak.org"&gt;Squeak&lt;/a&gt; has
a &lt;a href="http://www.squeakland.org/"&gt;low barrier&lt;/a&gt;, maybe using it to write
a simple game, with the hope that the reward of “I did it myself” is good
enough, would work? That is about the best I can come up with.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Why do I think this is important? Why not just let kids
be &lt;a href="http://www.squeakland.org/school/HTML/essays/dynabook_revisited.htm"&gt;computer
illiterate&lt;/a&gt;? I don't know. I think it's out of a sense of preserving culture
and skills, probably the same sense that a carpenter laments the passing of his
craft.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>hacking</category><category>observation</category><category>programming</category><category>thoughts</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/05/01/preserving-the-programming-craft.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2006 05:00:21 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
