This was a really useful feature for zooming in on small details, or to blow up videos without incurring high CPU overhead.



But since about X.org 1.7 this feature seems to be missing.  I've been researching and discovered why it's missing, and what to do about it.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So why is it missing?&lt;/h2&gt;

It's part of an architecture change in X.org and Linux, to support screen-mode switching for suspend/resume on laptop computers and a few other stability problems and useability things. Also it has something to do with the "kvm" module in the Linux kernel I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt;.  (KVM doesn't work with my Radeon driver, at least not the version included in openSUSE 11.2, yet openSUSE has it enabled by default in 11.2, but that's another story).

&lt;h2&gt;What can I do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;

You can look into screen magnifying software to make parts of the screen larger. Ew! (The whole point of switching screen mode is that the monitor does the magnification in hardware, rather than using the CPU or the GPU, so I can watch YouTube full-screen without the CPU having to multiply the pixels)



Alternatively this functionality is replaced by the new &lt;a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRandR"&gt;XRandR&lt;/a&gt; extension to X11. You can list the modes defined for your system, as well as the status of all your screens connected to your card with the command-line tool &lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xrandr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;

[~]archimedes$ &lt;strong&gt;xrandr&lt;/strong&gt;

Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1280 x 1024, maximum 3840 x 1200

VGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)

&lt;em&gt;DVI-0&lt;/em&gt; connected 1280x1024+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 338mm x 270mm panning 1280x1024+0+0
   &lt;em&gt;1280x1024&lt;/em&gt;      60.0*+   75.0     60.0*
   &lt;em&gt;1152x864&lt;/em&gt;       75.0
   &lt;em&gt;1024x768&lt;/em&gt;       75.0     70.1     60.0
   &lt;em&gt;832x624&lt;/em&gt;        74.6
   &lt;em&gt;800x600&lt;/em&gt;        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2
   &lt;em&gt;640x480&lt;/em&gt;        75.0     72.8     66.7     59.9
   &lt;em&gt;720x400&lt;/em&gt;        70.1
S-video disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)



&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

So from above info I can see:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My LCDs native resolution is 1280x1024&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;This screen is identified as "DVI-0" to xrandr&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The 1280x1024 mode is set as the Preferred mode (marked with a +) which makes sense because it matches the LCD&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;That mode is set as the Current mode (marked with a *)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have a list of the other modes available, as well as supported refresh rates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Now I can change screen mode like this:

&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;xrandr --output DVI-0 --mode 800x600 --panning 1280x1024&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That keeps the virtual screen at the same size but the actual display mode is 800x600 (without the --panning switch, the virtual screen size changes to match the mode, which isn't fun really).  I can switch back with:

&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;xrandr --output DVI-0 --mode 1280x1024 --panning 1280x1024&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now all that remains is to bind these commands to keyboard shortcuts. The way to do that depends on the desktop environment you use. I'm still looking into how to do it for KDE and / or Awesome.



Oh, and if I ever plug my screen in via the VGA port, I'd need to change the "DVI-0" to "VGA-0" on my machine.</description><category>XRandR</category><category>hacking</category><category>how-to</category><category>screens</category><category>x11</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2010/07/09/what-happened-to-my-ctrl-zoom-in-xorg.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2010 07:17:58 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>MS-Windows focus-follows-mouse Registry hacks</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2010/03/10/ms-windows-focus-follows-mouse-registry-hacks.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I like the "focus follows mouse" window-focussing model from X11, because
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I don't have to click on the window, just move the mouse and the window it's over is focussed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I can focus a window &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; bringing it to the front, which is sometimes handy. If I want it in front, I can click it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

However MS-Windows follows the old-fashioned, Macintosh/Smalltalk style of having users click on a window to focus it for the keyboard. How do you make MS-Windows behave more like X11?



&lt;!--more--&gt;I used to install &lt;strong&gt;TweakUI &lt;/strong&gt;from Microsoft, just so that I could turn on an X11-like focus-follows-mouse mode, but Microsoft don't make TweakUI for Vista (there is &lt;strong&gt;TweakVI &lt;/strong&gt;instead, if you want to Google for it. It's by some other company. It's not bad, but overkill for what I want to do).



In Vista, Microsoft added a GUI for this mode that's &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; what I want. You can do this:



Open Control Panel (new view, not Classic)

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&amp;gt; Ease of Access Center&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:60px;"&gt;&amp;gt; Make the mouse easier to use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:90px;"&gt;&amp;gt; [ ] Activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse&lt;/p&gt;

But this also brings the window to the front when it's focussed.  If that's what you want, then you're done. If you're like me and you want the window under the mouse to have keyboard focus, but you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want it brought to the front without clicking on it, you'll need to hack the Windows Registry. Here are some steps, which should be good for any release of Windows that is based on Windows NT (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, Win7):

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;strong&gt;regedit &lt;/strong&gt;(Win+R, regedit, OK)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open up the key &lt;strong&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change the value of the REG_DWORD &lt;strong&gt;ActiveWindowTracking&lt;/strong&gt; to 0x0000001 (1)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open up the key &lt;strong&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical OR&lt;/strong&gt; the first byte of the REG_BINARY &lt;strong&gt;UserPreferencesMask&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;.  That is, if the current value is df 3e 03 80 12 00 00 00, then leave the 'df' alone. If it's 9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 03 07 80 12 00 00 00 , change it to 9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;.. ..  and so on &lt;strong style="color:#7744ee;"&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To make the focus a little slower, so that pop-up windows are useable, you also want to change the focus timing. Change the REG_DWORD &lt;strong&gt;ActiveWindTrkTimeout&lt;/strong&gt; (also in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop) to the number of milliseconds to wait before focus shifts to the window under the mouse.  I like a value of 0x00000080 (128ms). You might like 200ms (c8), or some faster or slower value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;strong style="color:#7744ee;"&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt; If you can't do this hexadecimal bit twiddling math in your head (difficult if you're not a programmer), then Windows' Calc can do it for you: put it in Programmer and Hex modes, type the first byte (hex pair e.g. 9e), press the 'Or' button, then '1' and the '=' button.  If the number changes, that's what you replace the first byte with. Thanks to Erik in the comments below, I've finally figured this out and (I hope) clarified what to do..



So, in summary, the Registry keys are as follows for X11-like window focus:

&lt;pre&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USERS\Control Panel\Mouse

  REG_DWORD ActiveWindowTracking = 0x00000001  (1)

HKEY_CURRENT_USERS\Control Panel\Desktop

  REG_DWORD ActiveWindTrkTimeout = 0x00000080  (128)

  REG_BINARY UserPreferencesMask OR= 01 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..&lt;/pre&gt;

These registry hacks require a reboot to take effect.</description><category>desktop</category><category>geek</category><category>hacking</category><category>how-to</category><category>tip</category><category>useability</category><category>windows</category><category>x11</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2010/03/10/ms-windows-focus-follows-mouse-registry-hacks.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2010 03:42:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>XMing screen size and changing multiple monitors</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2009/02/20/xming-screen-size.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;My work's notebook (Windows XP) is running Xming as it's X11 server, and it travels between work, home and on the train.


My work office has  a docking station and a rotating second display. Typically if I start Xming with this display plugged in, Xming will adjust it's screen size to use both displays, but if I start it without the screen plugged in, it'll size to just the notebook screen. If I later add the 2nd screen (by docking the notebook), Xming won't use it without a restart. Also if I rotate the screen, only the top 1200 pixels will be used by Xming.



The solution is to specify a screen size to begin with that is as wide and tall as both of the screens.  On my docked notebook the two displays are the notebook's display (1920x1200 pixels)  and 2nd display (1600x1200 pixels, which rotates to 1200x1600). So that means the combined screen width is 3520 pixels, and the tallest screen hight is 1600 pixels.  Specify this to Xming when it starts:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;path\to\xming.exe :0 -clipboard -multiwindow &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#7722ff;"&gt;-screen 0 3520x1600&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;Now I can add/remove/rotate the second screen and still use all of it without restarting Xming.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>display</category><category>hacking</category><category>screens</category><category>tip</category><category>x11</category><category>xming</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2009/02/20/xming-screen-size.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2009 23:22:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Multiple Xming servers on a single Windows host</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2008/12/17/multiple-xming-servers-on-a-single-windows-host.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;One use-case we have at work for &lt;a title="Xming sourceforge" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming"&gt;Xming&lt;/a&gt; is to be the X11 server on a Windows RDP terminal server. For security reasons (don't ask!) we can only access certain Unix hosts via an RDP session from our desktops, not directly over the campus LAN. So, we installed Xming on the TS and it works well. Except if two or more people wish to use it at once. Then it's first come, first served.


&lt;!--more--&gt;I found a work-around for this that works, but is inelegant: start with a different display number argument.  For instance, the normal Xming start-up parameters are like this:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;D:\Programs\Xming\Xming.exe &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#7744ff;"&gt;:0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; -clipboard -multiwindow&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



Change the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color:#7744ff;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;:0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to be something else, and you can have a second (or third) instance running on the same host. Then, so long as you launch an xterm on the remote hosts using an item from your Xming menu, then it seems to pass the X11 packets back to your instance of the server, and not to other people on the same TS.



There are at least a couple of issues with this:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It's not very resource efficient. But I can't see a way around this, so long as we are using the RDP terminal server&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You need to manually allocate display numbers to different people. If two people pick the same number, one will lose (first come, first served again). But at least your clients won't end up on their server...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If anybody can think of a way to snoop which displays are already taken, then choose the next one, it'd be neat!</description><category>hacking</category><category>tip</category><category>x11</category><category>xming</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2008/12/17/multiple-xming-servers-on-a-single-windows-host.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2008 20:21:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Trouble with the New X11 server in Cygwin</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2008/11/26/new-x11-server-in-cygwin.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently upgraded my Cygwin install and noticed that Cygwin has switched it's X server &lt;code&gt;XWin.exe&lt;/code&gt; from the XFree86 codebase to the Xorg codebase. Besides an updated logo, it also has some other side-effects.


&lt;!--more--&gt;The first one I noticed is that the xterm now has a menu turned on by default. If this annoys you (like it did me), you can turn it off by adding the following to your &lt;code&gt;~/.Xdefaults&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XTerm*toolBar: off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



The next side-effect I haven't yet solved. I &lt;a title="how to set up cygwin's xwin menu" href="http://sinewalker.wordpress.com/2006/04/18/cygwin-systray-menu/"&gt;use the XWin menu&lt;/a&gt; to define some links to the servers I look after at work. I use &lt;code&gt;plink.exe&lt;/code&gt; (part of &lt;a title="PuTTY home page" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt;) to launch an xterm on the remote host, displayed locally, and using &lt;code&gt;pagent.exe&lt;/code&gt; to do the authentication. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MENU DEV_SERVERS {
    "Content Server" exec "D:/Programs/PuTTY/plink.exe -ssh -X -C -load someserverdef /usr/openwin/bin/xterm -name greenbackground -ls"
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

...



This used to work, but now nothing happens.  Interestingly, the command &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;work if you execute it directly from a bash shell. If anyone has an idea, I'd be grateful for their help :)

&lt;h5&gt;UPDATE: - 20081217 -- Use Xming, maybe&lt;/h5&gt;

I haven't yet figured out ssh-agent. However one work-around that I tried earlier and added in the comments was no good: the X clients started in a terminal that is forked off this way don't come through for some reason, to do with the way the X packets are tunnelled I think. So, I was motivated to try &lt;a title="Xming web site" href="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/"&gt;Xming&lt;/a&gt;.



Xming is being used quite successfully by my work colleagues who don't have a whole Cygwin stack on their machines. It's a lightweight X11 server for Windows, and it even uses Microsoft's OpenGL apparently. I'll have to try out some 3D clients from home soon to see what that gets me, but it could be good.



Anyway, for work, it seems to integrate very well with PuTTY. There's even a stand-alone putty you can &lt;a title="Xming sourceforge" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming"&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; that's pre-integrated, though it seems to also require the Xming server.



I also found that it'll serve my local X clients quite well. The most important of these is my emacs, of course. For that to work well, I had to download the extra fonts since emacs uses servers-side fonts. But it works and is indistinguishable from the X11 server that's built into Cygwin.



I haven't yet un-installed Cygwin's X server: I fear it could also remove clients and libraries, and I don't want the hastle just now of figuring that out.



A final note: It's menu config file is Xmingrc (no dot), which lives in Window's HOME %USERPROFILE%. Also, because it's got no Cygwin dependency, you can't launch local Cygwin X clients from this menu. At least, not without wrapping them in calls to Cygwin's run.exe, e.g.

&lt;p style="text-align:center;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;d:\cygwin\bin\run.exe -p /usr/X11R6/bin emacs -display 127.0.0.1:0.0 --debug-init&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>cygwin</category><category>hacking</category><category>help</category><category>problem</category><category>tip</category><category>x11</category><category>xming</category><category>xorg</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2008/11/26/new-x11-server-in-cygwin.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2008 23:07:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Remote desktop access on SuSE: Cygwin, X, XDMCP and SSH?  Nope.

What's worse is, I've never updated it since the promised update back in March 2007!


Let me clear things up (and save you wading through the whole article): If you want remote access to your openSUSE desktop from a networked thin client, then forget about X11, XDMCP, VNC or tunneling X through SSH. Use the &lt;a title="Nomachine's intro to NX" href="http://nomachine.com/documentation/html/intr-technology.html"&gt;NX&lt;/a&gt; protocol. You'll need to do the following:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a title="FreeNX -- an opensource implementation of an NX protocol server" href="http://freenx.berlios.de/"&gt;FreeNX&lt;/a&gt; on your openSUSE host. Some (slightly outdated, but usable) instructions are in Chapter 9 of the &lt;a title="openSUSE 10.2 Reference manual (PDF)" href="http://www.novell.com/documentation/opensuse102/pdfdoc/opensuse102_reference/opensuse102_reference.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;openSUSE 10.2 Reference manual&lt;/a&gt;. If you're using openSUSE 11.0 or newer, &lt;a title="FreeNX" href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.0&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;q=FreeNX"&gt;get the latest FreeNX package&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a title="All about openSUSE Build Service" href="http://build.opensuse.org/"&gt;openSUSE Build Service&lt;/a&gt; (there are &lt;a title="openSUSE one-click install standard" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Standards/One_Click_Install"&gt;one-click install&lt;/a&gt; buttons)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install an NX client on your remote terminal(s). &lt;a title="Nomachine home page" href="http://www.nomachine.com/"&gt;Nomachine&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a title="Nomachine's downloads page" href="http://www.nomachine.com/download.php"&gt;free NX clients&lt;/a&gt; for Linux, Mac, Windows and Solaris (even some experimental ones for PlayStation 2 and Zaurus!). If your remote terminal is running openSUSE, you could alternatively &lt;a title="Free NX client from OBS" href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.0&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;q=freenx-client"&gt;get an open-source NX client&lt;/a&gt; from the build service (or ask yourself: I'm running X locally, so why don't I just use good ole SSH and X11?)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Configure your NX client to connect to the openSUSE host, then log in and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The upshot: &lt;/strong&gt;I've done this with a FreeNX server and Nomachine's NX client for Windows XP, and it all "just works", except maybe for some font issues with older X clients like emacs (install extra font packages from nomachine to fix that), and some transparency effect issues I noticed in kwin4, probably to do with X11 extensions missing in the NX client. Not a big deal.



Read the rest of this article for the boring background and laughable false-starts in my quest for remote desktops in X... &amp;lt;blush/&amp;gt;



&lt;!--more--&gt;



...



What I would &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;love to be able to do is get a graphical log-in screen to my openSUSE box, and have the &lt;a title="KDE Screenshots (Google)" href="http://images.google.com.au/images?q=kde%20screenshot&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi"&gt;KDE &lt;/a&gt;environment displayed onto a single window within the WinXP desktop on the notebook (sort of like Windows' Remote Desktop feature &lt;code&gt;mstsc.exe&lt;/code&gt;, or the original &lt;a title="X Terminal (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_terminal"&gt;X Terminals&lt;/a&gt; we used when I was a student at &lt;a title="School of Computing, University of Tasmania" href="http://www.comp.utas.edu.au"&gt;UTas&lt;/a&gt; back in the nineties).  This way I'd have my full KDE desktop &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;it'd be really comfy to use.  So what do I need to do?



Okay, I've finally had enough time at home  to play with connecting to my &lt;a title="openSUSE home" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org"&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt; box from my work's laptop (WinXP) over my wireless LAN.  It's all groovy:  I can use &lt;a title="PuTTY home" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a title="Cygwin download mirrors" href="http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; command (&lt;code&gt;ssh -Y&lt;/code&gt; to enable X11 tunnelling) to log in, list files, run programs (even X clients, so long as I've started Cygwin's X server first) and it's all secured by an &lt;a title="OpenSSH home" href="http://www.openssh.org/"&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt; tunnel through the air between my study and my back deck (favorite place to work :-) ).  Note that using &lt;a title="Wireless standard 802.11b (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11#802.11g"&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt; is probably a little slow for running intensely graphical X clients like photo viewers or &lt;a title="Xaos fractal zoomer home" href="http://wmi.math.u-szeged.hu/xaos/doku.php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;xaos&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ( :-) ), even with a strong signal, but it's good for running an IDE or &lt;a title="Konquerer (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konquerer"&gt;Konquerer&lt;/a&gt;.  And if you add the &lt;code&gt;-C &lt;/code&gt;(Compress) switch to &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, it speeds up the intense app's nicely!



Well, obviously I'll need to start X on the WinXP box, without &lt;code&gt;-multiwindow&lt;/code&gt;, and to &lt;code&gt;-query&lt;/code&gt; for an &lt;a title="X Display Manager Control Protocol (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xdmcp"&gt;XDMCP&lt;/a&gt; server on the openSUSE box.  This should work, since I use a graphical login on openSUSE, which means an XDMCP server is already running (KDM).  So I' tried that, and it doesn't work. Why?



It turns out that nearly every Linux distro' has configured their X display managers (kdm, xdm or gdm) to &lt;em&gt;disable &lt;/em&gt;XDMCP access from external servers and instead only allows connections from &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. from the Linux machine itself).



Why have they done that?  Because XDMCP is insecure:  it transmits passwords in clear.  Also, you cannot secure XDMCP with SSH, as XDMCP uses UDP as well as TCP protocols :-( .  So it's insecure and it cannot be fixed, therefore distribution providers (wisely) disable it.  If I want to have a remote &lt;em&gt;desktop&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to just seeing individual &lt;em&gt;windows&lt;/em&gt; in my Windows desktop (which is cool, but not what I want), then I'll need to either not use SSH and be insecure, or use something else like &lt;a title="Tight VNC -- free VNC server/client" href="http://www.tightvnc.com/"&gt;VNC&lt;/a&gt;.



I'm going to opt for the (insecure) option of not using SSH for X desktop access, and stick to traditional XDMCP sessions.  My reasons for this are:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I want it to be &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;, and with as little overhead as possible (using VNC involves mucking about with session IDs, or &lt;a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/1311?r=s"&gt;running an extra X server on the Linux side&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I only intend to access my Linux desktop from within my (W)LAN.  I have a firewall in the router, so I can set it to disallow access to ports UDP/177 and TCP/6000 from the Internet (or, if it proves too difficult to do it at the router, I can set openSUSE's own firewall to do that)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My WLAN is encrypted  over the air anyway (WPA/PSK) and it's also using a silent SSID &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a MAC-address white-list, so it's pretty secure already.  The only way for somebody to sniff out my password is to be physically attached to my router&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So far I feel I can trust every computer attached to the LAN, since it's my own house.  If (&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;?) this changes (that is, once my son is old enough to hack the network, so maybe when he's about eight years old?), I might revisit tunneling XDMCP sessions via VNC through SSH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

So, how do you set up good ole' XDMCP under Linux? &lt;a title="Linux XDMCP HOWTO (The Linux Documentation Project)" href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO/"&gt;READ THE FINE HOW-TO&lt;/a&gt;.  It's that simple, just remember that this is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;secure kids.  If you need security, use VNC, or just &lt;code&gt;ssh -Y&lt;/code&gt; to your Linux host and run individual X clients (with an X server on your local machine). I've also read &lt;a title="Cygwin X-Free mailing list archive" href="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2004-06/msg00204.html"&gt;in a mailing list&lt;/a&gt; that it's possible to start KDE from an SSH session anyway.  I might give that a go first, since it would be nearly as simple as XDMCP, and also secure.  But I really want my desktop, so we'll see what happens first….



&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2007-03-26T08:22+1000 Update: &lt;/strong&gt; — Some mixed success



I've learned a couple of things over the week-end:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt; ssh -&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; (use gzip compression when transmitting packets) produces satisfactory speed for &lt;code&gt;xaos&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gwenview&lt;/code&gt;, even over my WLAN&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;PuTTY doesn't seem to work any faster, even with Compression Enabled. Perhaps it doesn't support OpenSSL's compression?  I don't know.  Anyway, I don't need PuTTY as long as I have Cygwin with &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can start the KDE desktop from an &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; session with the &lt;code&gt;startkde&lt;/code&gt; command.  However in openSUSE (at least my install) this takes a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to start, and eventually &lt;code&gt;kwin&lt;/code&gt; hangs on the notebook end.  On the client end (the openSUSE box), it maxes out the CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

So that was exciting and a little disappointing.  I'll need to experiment a little more it seems.  I got expected warnings about missing font paths and ALSA not working, but I was still hoping to get the desktop up, just with some reduced functionality.  There were also warnings about certain X server extensions being unavailable on the Cygwin X server, which I didn't expect, but again, they aren't critical (no transparency support etc.).  Perhaps there's some environment variables that KDM sets which are causing kwin or other desktop subsystems some grief when missing?



If I still can't get it working soon, I might start with XDMCP, or I might skip straight to VNC after all.  One other thing to try before getting too drastic is to see if the Linux on my notebook's VMWare can run my KDE desktop remotely, or to try booting the notebook from a LiveCD such as Knoppix….



&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2007-03-29T16:48+1000 Update: &lt;/strong&gt; — RTFM.  Indeed!



It's amazing what you can find out if you just read the manuals that come with your software.  Feeling silly now…I was exploring the &lt;a title="Novell openSUSE Reference manual (PDF)" href="http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/03/22/www.novell.com/documentation/opensuse102/pdfdoc/opensuse102_reference/opensuse102_reference.pdf"&gt;openSUSE Reference manual&lt;/a&gt; on the train home last night. Chapter nine is particularly interesting:  it describes FreeNX, a free remote desktop server, all ready to go on openSUSE, just install and follow the instructions.  There's even an &lt;a title="NX Client for Windows (NoMachine)" href="http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-windows.php"&gt;NX client for Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Much simpler, and still Free.



Looks like this is the way to go.  I'll try it out and do a (hopefully) final  update.</description><category>GUI</category><category>KDE</category><category>Unix</category><category>cygwin</category><category>freenx</category><category>hacking</category><category>how-to</category><category>linux</category><category>nomachine</category><category>nx</category><category>x11</category><category>xorg</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/03/22/remote-desktop-acces-suse-cygwin-x-and-xdmcp.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2007 02:59:02 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
