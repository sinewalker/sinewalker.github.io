The Cygwin package is still experimental, so Cygwin's setup program will select 21 by default.


&lt;!--more--&gt;I've been hanging out for the new features of 22, happily use it in Linux daily and want to also use it in my Cygwin. It's pretty simple to get it working in Cygwin (it's installable from setup.exe), but since it's an experimental package, you need to take notice of the version of emacs you're installing and make sure you cycle through the install versions and pick 22.1-&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; for these packages:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;emacs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;emacs-X11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;emacs-el&lt;/strong&gt; (you will need to install this, even if you're not interested in the elisp code, because the pre-compiled lisp code for Cygwin has some errors that cause the .elc to not load properly :( )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;There's also an important gotcha&lt;/strong&gt;:  &lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; time you run setup.exe to install/remove Cygwin packages, you need to make sure that these three emacs ones are cycled to "Keep" version 22! Otherwise you'll be unpleasantly surprised that emacs 21 is installed...



Also: version 22 seems rather unstable for cygwin. It frequently crashes on my employer's WinXP SP2 platform. I'm not sure why, usually it happens in comint modes (like shell mode, for instance) but it can just crash mid-way through lisp operations also. This is annoying, but not critical (unless you're in the middle of a vi/emacs war with colleagues). My advice: make sure autosave is turned on, and make use of &lt;code&gt;M-x recover-session&lt;/code&gt;.



The Free Software Foundation &lt;a title="GNU Emacs 22.2 NEWS file" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.22.2"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on 2008-03-26 that version 22.2 of emacs has been released. Maybe when the cygwin package is built, it'll be more stable. In the mean-time, I find the new features too invaluable to move back to 21, so I'll put up with the occasional crash (and save my work often!)



&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2008-05-07T1656+10 Update:&lt;/strong&gt;



I've just installed the version of emacs 22.2 compiled for Cygwin, prepared by &lt;a title="Angelo Graziosi's emacs 22.2 compiled for Cygwin" href="http://www.webalice.it/angelo.graziosi/cygwin/emacs/Emacs.html"&gt;Angelo Graziosi&lt;/a&gt;. It seems to be much more stable than the 22.1 version in Cygwin's repository, plus 22.2 has a few minor feature enhancements that are nice to boot!</description><category>cygwin</category><category>emacs</category><category>hacking</category><category>package</category><category>tip</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2008/04/04/cygwin-and-emacs-22.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2008 23:09:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>“Get into the habbit of reading source docs”</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2005/10/27/get-into-the-habbit-of-reading-source-docs.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally published

      &lt;hr&gt;
      

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt; The great thing about Linux is that all the definitive
documentation (including the source code) comes with the OS. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://books.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=166454&amp;amp;threshold=-1&amp;amp;commentsort=0&amp;amp;mode=thread&amp;amp;cid=13883477"&gt;Slashdot quote&lt;/a&gt;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You know, I'm finding that for a lot of the “beginner” linux distro's, this is
not true.  Yes, the source is &lt;em&gt;available&lt;/em&gt; but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;come with
the OS&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Granted, not everyone wants to fill their harddrives with source tarballs or
SRPMs on the off chance they might want to read them, but only a few distro's I
know come with source, and those are not necessarily for noob's. the main
example that comes to mind is Gentoo (since it's a “ports”-like
distribution). This is not to wax lyrical on the benefits of Gentoo for
learning Linux (Gentoo has many weaknesses in that regard too, among its
inappropriateness as a general OS for noob's), just that it's the only one I've
found where the source &lt;em&gt;comes with the OS&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Other distro's with source “available” are Debian and Fedora (on extra CDs you
have to download, and Fedora locks the source into SRPMs which is another
learning hurdle to leap over, especially bad if all you want to do is read the
source comments, or documentation not included in the binary RPM). It makes me
feel like a 2nd-class citizen, that the source is somehow “open” but you have
to know the secret handshake to get at it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
All of this, just to say: while reading source docs is a laudable habbit and I
share your wish to encourage it, I can also see how it is difficult for most
Linux noob's to form this habbit so long as the source doesn't actually come
with the OS, which for a great many distro's it does not. The extra steps to
download (and in many cases extract from SRPMs) the source are probably enough
of a deterrent to forming this habit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
unfortunately, hacker habbits require hacker motivation :-(
