I braved the contempt of my friends last week and ventured out to see

"Bambi", the Disney rerelease that is proving to be a hit once again in the

box office. I was looking forward to a gentle, soothing, late afternoon

relief from the Washington Summer. Instead I was traumatized. As a

psycho-sexual return to the horrors of early adolescence, it couldn't be

more effective. For the first half-hour, you're lulled into an agreeable

sense of security and comfort. Birds twitter; small rabbits turn out to be

great conversationalists. Pop is what Senator Moynihan would describe as an

absent father, but Mom's there to make you feel OK in the odd thunderstorm.

You make great friends, fool around on the ice, discover the meadow,

generally mellow out. Then, without any particular warning, your mom gets

shot, your voice breaks, huge growths start appearing on your head, and

your peers start heading off into the clover with the apparent intention of

having sex. Next thing you know, the forest burns down. If I were still

eight, I think I'd prefer _Rambo III_."

When I was young, my family bought a color TV. Our neigbors, who were

poorer, had only a black-and-white set. They bought a piece of cellophane,

This will be, what, my &lt;strong&gt;fifth &lt;/strong&gt;(or sixth if you count Knoppix, but I never put that on my hard drive) Linux distro since trying out RedHat 5.2 back in 1999.  Previous to this I was using openSUSE 10.2 which is not a bad distro either and I always had my eye on SuSE.  So, why yet another distro change?



&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;openSUSE's YaST tool.  It's sssoooo sssllloooowww.  Even Gentoo's Portage is faster for installing software, and &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;has to compile the programs from source code!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ZMD doesn't work.  It keeps breaking, crashing or going ballistic with the CPU&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is with all the susefications?  I really don't like the system menu in openSUSE and couldn't  find a way to turn it off&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some vital programs don't run:  Rosegarden and Google Earth lock up, FlightGear just won't run&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Like others in the community, I am grateful to Novell for what they have done in their fight with SCO, but unsure about their deal with Microsoft.  I like to think that perhaps the CEO is just a little naïve about M$ (or hasn't been bitten by them like me — I don't trust the Novell version of OpenOffice to be hands-off on my document, and not fiddle the format somehow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is a shame since I do really like openSUSE, but this issue, together with the technical nags has tipped me over the edge and I'm moving on.



So, like was &lt;a title="Comment on " href="http://sinewalker.wordpress.com/2006/01/24/linux-distro-woes/#comments"&gt;suggested to me&lt;/a&gt; a bit over a year ago,  I'm switching to Kubuntu.  It's the latest favourite distro and has good reviews, from &lt;a title="aseigo - key KDE developer" href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/"&gt;people &lt;/a&gt;I &lt;a title="canllaith - KDE documentor" href="http://www.canllaith.org/"&gt;respect &lt;/a&gt;in the KDE community, so my initial fears a year ago about it's KDE support being sub-par would seem to be unfounded.



I have to say:  switching to kubuntu has been the easiest Linux distro migration I have ever undertaken in eight years! Twenty minutes to install on my three-year-old home-built PC (Athlon XP1800+, 512MiB RAM, IDE drives, Radeon rv280 GPU and a 48cm LCD, plus other bits). Also, this is the first time that I've been able to surf the Net while an operating system installs itself! Yes, most Linuxen let you switch to another VT and run console programs, but no other installer I've seen lets you run a graphical KDE session while it installs, which is impressive and also very useful — I can read the installation manual on the Net while I install, no need to print it out or have a second computer running to one side.



Package installation is a breeze, and Feisty comes with the "universe" and "multiverse" repositories enabled, so getting "restricted formats" working took 10 minutes, and the installer was smart enough to configure APT to use a local mirror in Australia too! Very fast and very cool.



And to top it off:  Google Earth works and Beryl was a snap to install compared to getting Compiz working properly in SUSE.  I haven't tried Rosegarden yet (there's a lot of audio and JACK stuff to set up for it first) but even if that still won't work, Kubuntu's already working better than SUSE on my hardware.  Very satisfied.</description><category>KDE</category><category>Unix</category><category>alternatives</category><category>hacking</category><category>kubuntu</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/05/16/kubuntu-kaboose.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2007 22:53:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Remote desktop access on SuSE: Cygwin, X, XDMCP and SSH?  Nope.  FreeNX!</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/03/22/remote-desktop-acces-suse-cygwin-x-and-xdmcp.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;strong&gt;MJL20080827 -- Update&lt;/strong&gt;:  I Just realised that this is one of my top-visited pages and it's a totally disorganised and incongruent pile of... What's worse is, I've never updated it since the promised update back in March 2007!


Let me clear things up (and save you wading through the whole article): If you want remote access to your openSUSE desktop from a networked thin client, then forget about X11, XDMCP, VNC or tunneling X through SSH. Use the &lt;a title="Nomachine's intro to NX" href="http://nomachine.com/documentation/html/intr-technology.html"&gt;NX&lt;/a&gt; protocol. You'll need to do the following:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a title="FreeNX -- an opensource implementation of an NX protocol server" href="http://freenx.berlios.de/"&gt;FreeNX&lt;/a&gt; on your openSUSE host. Some (slightly outdated, but usable) instructions are in Chapter 9 of the &lt;a title="openSUSE 10.2 Reference manual (PDF)" href="http://www.novell.com/documentation/opensuse102/pdfdoc/opensuse102_reference/opensuse102_reference.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;openSUSE 10.2 Reference manual&lt;/a&gt;. If you're using openSUSE 11.0 or newer, &lt;a title="FreeNX" href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.0&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;q=FreeNX"&gt;get the latest FreeNX package&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a title="All about openSUSE Build Service" href="http://build.opensuse.org/"&gt;openSUSE Build Service&lt;/a&gt; (there are &lt;a title="openSUSE one-click install standard" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Standards/One_Click_Install"&gt;one-click install&lt;/a&gt; buttons)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install an NX client on your remote terminal(s). &lt;a title="Nomachine home page" href="http://www.nomachine.com/"&gt;Nomachine&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a title="Nomachine's downloads page" href="http://www.nomachine.com/download.php"&gt;free NX clients&lt;/a&gt; for Linux, Mac, Windows and Solaris (even some experimental ones for PlayStation 2 and Zaurus!). If your remote terminal is running openSUSE, you could alternatively &lt;a title="Free NX client from OBS" href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.0&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;q=freenx-client"&gt;get an open-source NX client&lt;/a&gt; from the build service (or ask yourself: I'm running X locally, so why don't I just use good ole SSH and X11?)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Configure your NX client to connect to the openSUSE host, then log in and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The upshot: &lt;/strong&gt;I've done this with a FreeNX server and Nomachine's NX client for Windows XP, and it all "just works", except maybe for some font issues with older X clients like emacs (install extra font packages from nomachine to fix that), and some transparency effect issues I noticed in kwin4, probably to do with X11 extensions missing in the NX client. Not a big deal.



Read the rest of this article for the boring background and laughable false-starts in my quest for remote desktops in X... &amp;lt;blush/&amp;gt;



&lt;!--more--&gt;



...



What I would &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;love to be able to do is get a graphical log-in screen to my openSUSE box, and have the &lt;a title="KDE Screenshots (Google)" href="http://images.google.com.au/images?q=kde%20screenshot&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi"&gt;KDE &lt;/a&gt;environment displayed onto a single window within the WinXP desktop on the notebook (sort of like Windows' Remote Desktop feature &lt;code&gt;mstsc.exe&lt;/code&gt;, or the original &lt;a title="X Terminal (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_terminal"&gt;X Terminals&lt;/a&gt; we used when I was a student at &lt;a title="School of Computing, University of Tasmania" href="http://www.comp.utas.edu.au"&gt;UTas&lt;/a&gt; back in the nineties).  This way I'd have my full KDE desktop &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;it'd be really comfy to use.  So what do I need to do?



Okay, I've finally had enough time at home  to play with connecting to my &lt;a title="openSUSE home" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org"&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt; box from my work's laptop (WinXP) over my wireless LAN.  It's all groovy:  I can use &lt;a title="PuTTY home" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a title="Cygwin download mirrors" href="http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; command (&lt;code&gt;ssh -Y&lt;/code&gt; to enable X11 tunnelling) to log in, list files, run programs (even X clients, so long as I've started Cygwin's X server first) and it's all secured by an &lt;a title="OpenSSH home" href="http://www.openssh.org/"&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt; tunnel through the air between my study and my back deck (favorite place to work :-) ).  Note that using &lt;a title="Wireless standard 802.11b (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11#802.11g"&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt; is probably a little slow for running intensely graphical X clients like photo viewers or &lt;a title="Xaos fractal zoomer home" href="http://wmi.math.u-szeged.hu/xaos/doku.php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;xaos&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ( :-) ), even with a strong signal, but it's good for running an IDE or &lt;a title="Konquerer (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konquerer"&gt;Konquerer&lt;/a&gt;.  And if you add the &lt;code&gt;-C &lt;/code&gt;(Compress) switch to &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, it speeds up the intense app's nicely!



Well, obviously I'll need to start X on the WinXP box, without &lt;code&gt;-multiwindow&lt;/code&gt;, and to &lt;code&gt;-query&lt;/code&gt; for an &lt;a title="X Display Manager Control Protocol (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xdmcp"&gt;XDMCP&lt;/a&gt; server on the openSUSE box.  This should work, since I use a graphical login on openSUSE, which means an XDMCP server is already running (KDM).  So I' tried that, and it doesn't work. Why?



It turns out that nearly every Linux distro' has configured their X display managers (kdm, xdm or gdm) to &lt;em&gt;disable &lt;/em&gt;XDMCP access from external servers and instead only allows connections from &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. from the Linux machine itself).



Why have they done that?  Because XDMCP is insecure:  it transmits passwords in clear.  Also, you cannot secure XDMCP with SSH, as XDMCP uses UDP as well as TCP protocols :-( .  So it's insecure and it cannot be fixed, therefore distribution providers (wisely) disable it.  If I want to have a remote &lt;em&gt;desktop&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to just seeing individual &lt;em&gt;windows&lt;/em&gt; in my Windows desktop (which is cool, but not what I want), then I'll need to either not use SSH and be insecure, or use something else like &lt;a title="Tight VNC -- free VNC server/client" href="http://www.tightvnc.com/"&gt;VNC&lt;/a&gt;.



I'm going to opt for the (insecure) option of not using SSH for X desktop access, and stick to traditional XDMCP sessions.  My reasons for this are:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I want it to be &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;, and with as little overhead as possible (using VNC involves mucking about with session IDs, or &lt;a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/1311?r=s"&gt;running an extra X server on the Linux side&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I only intend to access my Linux desktop from within my (W)LAN.  I have a firewall in the router, so I can set it to disallow access to ports UDP/177 and TCP/6000 from the Internet (or, if it proves too difficult to do it at the router, I can set openSUSE's own firewall to do that)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My WLAN is encrypted  over the air anyway (WPA/PSK) and it's also using a silent SSID &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a MAC-address white-list, so it's pretty secure already.  The only way for somebody to sniff out my password is to be physically attached to my router&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So far I feel I can trust every computer attached to the LAN, since it's my own house.  If (&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;?) this changes (that is, once my son is old enough to hack the network, so maybe when he's about eight years old?), I might revisit tunneling XDMCP sessions via VNC through SSH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

So, how do you set up good ole' XDMCP under Linux? &lt;a title="Linux XDMCP HOWTO (The Linux Documentation Project)" href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO/"&gt;READ THE FINE HOW-TO&lt;/a&gt;.  It's that simple, just remember that this is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;secure kids.  If you need security, use VNC, or just &lt;code&gt;ssh -Y&lt;/code&gt; to your Linux host and run individual X clients (with an X server on your local machine). I've also read &lt;a title="Cygwin X-Free mailing list archive" href="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2004-06/msg00204.html"&gt;in a mailing list&lt;/a&gt; that it's possible to start KDE from an SSH session anyway.  I might give that a go first, since it would be nearly as simple as XDMCP, and also secure.  But I really want my desktop, so we'll see what happens first….



&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2007-03-26T08:22+1000 Update: &lt;/strong&gt; — Some mixed success



I've learned a couple of things over the week-end:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt; ssh -&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; (use gzip compression when transmitting packets) produces satisfactory speed for &lt;code&gt;xaos&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gwenview&lt;/code&gt;, even over my WLAN&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;PuTTY doesn't seem to work any faster, even with Compression Enabled. Perhaps it doesn't support OpenSSL's compression?  I don't know.  Anyway, I don't need PuTTY as long as I have Cygwin with &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can start the KDE desktop from an &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; session with the &lt;code&gt;startkde&lt;/code&gt; command.  However in openSUSE (at least my install) this takes a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to start, and eventually &lt;code&gt;kwin&lt;/code&gt; hangs on the notebook end.  On the client end (the openSUSE box), it maxes out the CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

So that was exciting and a little disappointing.  I'll need to experiment a little more it seems.  I got expected warnings about missing font paths and ALSA not working, but I was still hoping to get the desktop up, just with some reduced functionality.  There were also warnings about certain X server extensions being unavailable on the Cygwin X server, which I didn't expect, but again, they aren't critical (no transparency support etc.).  Perhaps there's some environment variables that KDM sets which are causing kwin or other desktop subsystems some grief when missing?



If I still can't get it working soon, I might start with XDMCP, or I might skip straight to VNC after all.  One other thing to try before getting too drastic is to see if the Linux on my notebook's VMWare can run my KDE desktop remotely, or to try booting the notebook from a LiveCD such as Knoppix….



&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2007-03-29T16:48+1000 Update: &lt;/strong&gt; — RTFM.  Indeed!



It's amazing what you can find out if you just read the manuals that come with your software.  Feeling silly now…I was exploring the &lt;a title="Novell openSUSE Reference manual (PDF)" href="http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/03/22/www.novell.com/documentation/opensuse102/pdfdoc/opensuse102_reference/opensuse102_reference.pdf"&gt;openSUSE Reference manual&lt;/a&gt; on the train home last night. Chapter nine is particularly interesting:  it describes FreeNX, a free remote desktop server, all ready to go on openSUSE, just install and follow the instructions.  There's even an &lt;a title="NX Client for Windows (NoMachine)" href="http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-windows.php"&gt;NX client for Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Much simpler, and still Free.



Looks like this is the way to go.  I'll try it out and do a (hopefully) final  update.</description><category>GUI</category><category>KDE</category><category>Unix</category><category>cygwin</category><category>freenx</category><category>hacking</category><category>how-to</category><category>linux</category><category>nomachine</category><category>nx</category><category>x11</category><category>xorg</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/03/22/remote-desktop-acces-suse-cygwin-x-and-xdmcp.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2007 02:59:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Mainframe is process-centred, *nix/windoze is not</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2005/07/18/mainframe-is-process-centred-nixwindoze-is-not.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally published
    at &lt;a href="http://sinewalker.blogspot.com.au/2005_07_01_archive.html"&gt;sinewalker.blogspot.com.au&lt;/a&gt; on 18 July 2005&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In reference
  to &lt;a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/18/2035235&amp;amp;tid=190"&gt;this Slashdot question&lt;/a&gt; about Mainframe Culture&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;    
&lt;p&gt;Appart from the obvious religious stuff about GUI (or lack of) and
user-centred interfaces (or lack of), the biggest difference, and the biggest
advantage that Mainframe brings is it's culture of process and change
control. It is something you should strive to let your Mainframe masters pass
on to the *nix/windoze padawans before they die of old age.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am a *nix padawan, but, crocky technology asside, I'm frequently impressed by
my Mainframe elders, their ability to deploy code to Production environments
that works *the first time* nearly every time, and their ability to
communictate technical changes necessary to fix broken code in the middle of
the night in the 0.1% of cases where they failed to get it working first time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Key values that I have picked up from my masters, and which should be
inherrited by both *nix and PC/Mac enclaves are focused around Engineering
principles. Mainframe guru's program like a civil engineer builds a bridge. No
shortcuts are taken unless it can be proven that it is safe to do so. Testing
is carried out in stages and test results must be submitted with the change
request before a program migrates to Production. If a program must “abend”
(Abnormal End) then it should do so noisily and with as much information as
possible. If it finishes cleanly, little information is needed other than this
fact.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
These closely follow the
advice &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/"&gt;Raymond&lt;/a&gt; has encoded
in &lt;a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/taoup/html/"&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt;, but
there is probably much more that your Mainframe gurus know that you should
cherrish and extend to your newer team members.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Forget about the religious wars, the technology changes and the “focus” of your
programmers on users or other programmers. Get the real truth from your
Mainframe masters who have seen it all pass before them but have learned the
hard way how to make a stable computer environment that stays up, even on
cruddy mainframe technology. If their attitudes were adopted by people fluent
in today's fantastic systems, all people would benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The sad fact is that, in today's environment, especially after the dot-com
cowboys set Upper Management expectations, following Process is just too slow,
or too expensive. Convincing management that a bigger cost up front will result
in a lower cost in the long run is also futile when mgt sees it as “normal” for
computer systems to break. After all, their Windows machine on their desk has
been doing that for 20 years now, so it must be normal, right?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
What matters most to managers or clients when deploying new systems these days
seems to be “time to market”, and the only consent to quality is that the IT
dept/company follows check-list processes like CMMI or ISO9000 which do not
address the real issues and put too much into the Process rather than the
Result. Also, when the system breaks, it's typically at the expense of the IT
company that built it, or was stupid enough to agree to use the off-the-shelf
product in the first place, so there is nothing to drive a change of behaviour
from the clients.&lt;/p&gt;
