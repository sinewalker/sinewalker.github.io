<hr>
<p>You can use the following XHTML entity names to put propper punctuation symbols into your web pages.
</p>

<br><p>
The W3C maintains <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/entities.html">a complete list</a>, though finding what you need can be a bit tricky.  I'm working on a complete list that actually displays the characters together with the other detail from W3C's table, a lot neater coding than this Blogger post too, I hope…
</p>

<br><p>
In the mean-time, here's a short-list of common characters that I use quite a
lot:</p>

<br>



Double quotes: <b>“     ”</b> ⇒  use  <b>&amp;ldquo;</b>
and   <b>&amp;rdquo;</b>
<br>


Single quotes: <b>‘     ’</b> ⇒  use  <b>&amp;lsquo;</b>
and <b>&amp;rsquo;</b>
<br>


Ellipsis:      <b>…</b>  ⇒ use  <b>&amp;hellip;</b>
<br>


En-dash:       <b>–</b> ⇒ use      <b>&amp;ndash;</b>
<br>


Em-dash:       <b>—</b> ⇒ use     <b>&amp;mdash;</b>
<br>


Minus sign:    <b>−</b> ⇒ use   <b>&amp;minus;</b>
<br>




Multiplication: <b>×</b>   ⇒ use  <b>&amp;times;</b>
<br>


Division:       <b>÷</b>    ⇒ use   <b>&amp;divide;</b>
<br>


Approximately equal: <b>≈</b>   ⇒ use  <b>&amp;asymp;</b>
<br>




Trade Mark:  ™   ⇒ use <b>&amp;trade;</b>
<br>


Copyright:   <b>©</b> ⇒ use <b>&amp;copy;</b>
<br>


Registered:  <b>®</b> ⇒ use <b>&amp;reg;</b>
<br>




Right-arrow: <b>⇒</b> ⇒ use <b>&amp;rArr;</b>
<br>

<hr>
<p>Well, here's a first for me:  go to local Dick Smith's, buy a
      cheap printer, for my wife  (HP Deskjet 3940, AU$66).  Because I don't
      really care about printing from Linux, I didn't care if it works or not
      on that OS, just bought whatever Windows printer was cheapest.</p>

<br><p>
Brought it home, plugged it into my PC (in Windows) and it works, after installing drivers and software and about 15 mins of setup time.</p>

<br><p>
For the heck of it, I rebooted to Linux to see what would happen.  Well lordy
“New hardware detected:  HPdeskjet3940” and an offer to set it up. After 5
minutes — just accepting all the standard options — out comes a test page, in
colour, bi-directional and fast.</p>

<br><p>
Neat.  Linux is ready for me....</p>

So I'll have to play again, and make a map too... 'cause it's the geek thing to do.
</p>

<br><h4>UPDATE: 20081126 - Finding the egg</h4>
<p>
As noted in the cheats above, the egg is in a random spot between rooms 60-78 (inclusive). Here are two stategies (besides peeking at the <code>dunnet.el</code> code) for finding the egg:
</p>

<br><ol>
<li>In the <em>pokey </em>Unix environment (in-game) do directory listings of all the rooms between Main and Fourth St, intersecting between Maple and Sycamore Ave. If the room contains the egg, it'll be listed as egg.o in the Unix environment. Note where it is, then go and fetch it.</li>
	<li>Head along Main St looking for the egg, then up and down First, Second, Third... &amp;c. until you find it.</li>
</ol>
<br><p>
Another idea to try (theoretical, but interesting, from TimHorse' comment below):
</p>

<br><ul>
<li>Login to <em>pokey </em>as the wizard, then type <code><strong>echo $dun-room-objects</strong></code> to find out where ALL of the objects are, find the egg (item 18, see <code><strong>$dun-objects</strong></code>) then have a look at <strong><code>$dun-rooms</code></strong>...</li>
</ul>
<br><p>
More ideas to try as the wizard in <em>pokey </em>(from some tips at the <a title="Ron Schnell" href="http://www.driver-aces.com/ronnie.html">Dunnet author</a>'s <a title="Ronnie's Dunnet hints" href="http://www.driver-aces.com/dunnet.html">hints page</a>):
</p>

<br><ul>
<li>
<strong><code>dun-current-room=tloc</code></strong> to go directly to the room containing the egg</li>
	<li>
<code><strong>dun-items='(append 18 dun-items)</strong></code>, to add the egg to your inventory directly (a truely <a title="Moby definition (jargon file)" href="../jargon/html/M/moby.html">moby</a> <a title="definition (jargon file)" href="../jargon/html/H/hack.html">hack</a>)</li>
</ul>
<br><p>
I'm actually motivated to play this game on the train tonight...
</p>

<br><p>
I still haven't made a map, maybe one day. It should be fairly simple to use the code as a starting point, but the up/down could be tricky to map.</p>

against the dogma of the DMCA.</p>

I think I may have figured out the issue with my CD recorder.  It seems to fail
more when the weather is hot (as in, more than 32° C ambient).  The internal
case temperature would be in the low to mid 40s then, and this is probably
close to the maximum operating temperature for the device (a SONY CD-RW
CRX140E).</p>


<br><p>
Bummer.
</p>

<br><p>
So, either I confine my CD writing to early in the morings on hot nights, or I

<hr>
<p>Well, my flirtations with gentoo didn't last too long.  I'm now trying SuSE 10.0 out, which — yes — is an RPM-based distro!
</p>
 
<br><p>
So, why did I leave gentoo? I suppose that the "distro that doesn't get in your way" got in my way. With the arrival of our first baby, I'm rather short on the hours needed to learn how to configure everything in gentoo. While it's true that I could stand to learn a lot from getting it all to work, I can't afford to be hacking around getting pesky things like the scanner to go, or printing, or figuring out why I suddenly cannot burn a CD anymore. I need a "linux for dummies" that just works, and is more stable than winblows. Of course, if money was no object, I'd get myself a nice shiny new dual G5 Macintosh, but that's just for my dreams.
</p>

<br><p>
So, since Novel have decided to open up SuSE a bit more now, I'm trying it out. I downloaded the "Evaluation" version, rather than OpenSuse, since I'm not an OpenSource zealot, and frankly I'd like to visit web sites with flash animations. It has crippled xine/kaffeine and no DVDCSS, but I can live without movies for now until I get that sorted, or build from the source I have, or even (ick!) just boot to Windows (though I know of no free DVD players for win32 that expand a 16:9 movie to fill as much of my 4:3 screen as Kaffeine does).
</p>

<br><p>
So, it installed well, I now have working scanner, printer, cd-rw, dhcpd, cvs, mysql, java (yay!), apache, tomcat, kde. No Audacity or Rosegarden (important apps for me), no Eclipse (can wait). Slightly out-of-date jedit (4.1) and about 250MB of patches to upgrade to at some point, or not, since on dial-up I'm not exactly a cracker target...
</p>

<br><p>
I'm very happy with SuSE so far. It's as pleasant as I always thought it would be. YaST is nice too. Only problem: sometimes cdrecord bombs, still (!). Pisses me off, it worked once but not again, even as root. It can sit on the back-burner (oops) until after I've got my missing audio software installed
</p>

<br><p>
Major projects for linux are:
</p>

<br><ul>
<li>Record old music tapes to OGG and burn to data and audio CDs</li>
	<li>Get nice video editing software (kino) working for baby and burn to VCDs</li>
	<li>Java hacking (install Sun Java Studio sharchives)</li>
	<li>Photo indexing and database, then archive to CDs</li>
	<li>Produce a CD database</li>
	<li>Get a working backup solution running</li>
</ul>
<br><p>
Obviously, I need to get cd-rw sorted as a priority... it's kinda central!</p>

<p>Now playing with <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> as my latest
Linux of choice (I got fed up with RPM dependancy problems, and Gentoo being
source-based solves my other issue with binary-based distributions, where I
felt like a 2nd-class citizen when using or accessing source code).
</p>

<br><p>
So, I've got <a href="http://xinehq.de/">Xine</a> working, but can only use
shared memory for the video decoding.  This is great if I want to capture
screen shots, but not for high-speed movies such as The Matrix, or even just
reading the credits on The Lord of the Ring.  So need to "fix" the performance.
</p>

<br><p>
I used to have Mandrake
running <a href="http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Main_Page">v4l</a>
+ <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/video-playback.html">xv</a>,
but I can't have installed it right in Gentoo because, although xv is loaded,
the performance is glacial if I try to use it.
</p>

<br><p>
I
found <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/xine-howto/en_GB/html/howto-9.html">this
old How-to</a> with some advice to try... but I might also want to look at
the <a href="http://xinehq.de/index.php/faq">FAQ</a>.... probably I haven't
built something into the kernel.
</p>

<br><p>
Also while reading around, I
discovered <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">Mplayer</a>.  This looks
like it's worth a download...</p>

<blockquote><em> The great thing about Linux is that all the definitive
documentation (including the source code) comes with the OS. </em></blockquote>
<p>
(<a href="http://books.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=166454&amp;threshold=-1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=13883477">Slashdot quote</a>)
</p>
<br><p>
You know, I'm finding that for a lot of the “beginner” linux distro's, this is
not true.  Yes, the source is <em>available</em> but it doesn't <em>come with
the OS</em>.</p>

<br><p>
Granted, not everyone wants to fill their harddrives with source tarballs or
SRPMs on the off chance they might want to read them, but only a few distro's I
know come with source, and those are not necessarily for noob's. the main
example that comes to mind is Gentoo (since it's a “ports”-like
distribution). This is not to wax lyrical on the benefits of Gentoo for
learning Linux (Gentoo has many weaknesses in that regard too, among its
inappropriateness as a general OS for noob's), just that it's the only one I've
found where the source <em>comes with the OS</em>.
</p>

<br><p>
Other distro's with source “available” are Debian and Fedora (on extra CDs you
have to download, and Fedora locks the source into SRPMs which is another
learning hurdle to leap over, especially bad if all you want to do is read the
source comments, or documentation not included in the binary RPM). It makes me
feel like a 2nd-class citizen, that the source is somehow “open” but you have
to know the secret handshake to get at it.
</p>

<br><p>
All of this, just to say: while reading source docs is a laudable habbit and I
share your wish to encourage it, I can also see how it is difficult for most
Linux noob's to form this habbit so long as the source doesn't actually come
with the OS, which for a great many distro's it does not. The extra steps to
download (and in many cases extract from SRPMs) the source are probably enough
of a deterrent to forming this habit.
</p>

<br><p>
unfortunately, hacker habbits require hacker motivation :-(

<em>In reference
  to <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/18/2035235&amp;tid=190">this Slashdot question</a> about Mainframe Culture</em>
</p>
<br><p>Appart from the obvious religious stuff about GUI (or lack of) and
user-centred interfaces (or lack of), the biggest difference, and the biggest
advantage that Mainframe brings is it's culture of process and change
control. It is something you should strive to let your Mainframe masters pass
on to the *nix/windoze padawans before they die of old age.
</p>

<br><p>
I am a *nix padawan, but, crocky technology asside, I'm frequently impressed by
my Mainframe elders, their ability to deploy code to Production environments
that works *the first time* nearly every time, and their ability to
communictate technical changes necessary to fix broken code in the middle of
the night in the 0.1% of cases where they failed to get it working first time.
</p>

<br><p>
Key values that I have picked up from my masters, and which should be
inherrited by both *nix and PC/Mac enclaves are focused around Engineering
principles. Mainframe guru's program like a civil engineer builds a bridge. No
shortcuts are taken unless it can be proven that it is safe to do so. Testing
is carried out in stages and test results must be submitted with the change
request before a program migrates to Production. If a program must “abend”
(Abnormal End) then it should do so noisily and with as much information as
possible. If it finishes cleanly, little information is needed other than this
fact.
</p>

<br><p>
These closely follow the
advice <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/">Raymond</a> has encoded
in <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/taoup/html/">his book</a>, but
there is probably much more that your Mainframe gurus know that you should
cherrish and extend to your newer team members.
</p>

<br><p>
Forget about the religious wars, the technology changes and the “focus” of your
programmers on users or other programmers. Get the real truth from your
Mainframe masters who have seen it all pass before them but have learned the
hard way how to make a stable computer environment that stays up, even on
cruddy mainframe technology. If their attitudes were adopted by people fluent
in today's fantastic systems, all people would benefit.
</p>

<br><p>
The sad fact is that, in today's environment, especially after the dot-com
cowboys set Upper Management expectations, following Process is just too slow,
or too expensive. Convincing management that a bigger cost up front will result
in a lower cost in the long run is also futile when mgt sees it as “normal” for
computer systems to break. After all, their Windows machine on their desk has
been doing that for 20 years now, so it must be normal, right?
</p>

<br><p>
What matters most to managers or clients when deploying new systems these days
seems to be “time to market”, and the only consent to quality is that the IT
dept/company follows check-list processes like CMMI or ISO9000 which do not
address the real issues and put too much into the Process rather than the
Result. Also, when the system breaks, it's typically at the expense of the IT
company that built it, or was stupid enough to agree to use the off-the-shelf
product in the first place, so there is nothing to drive a change of behaviour
from the clients.</p>

<p>Place these settings in your <a href="http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/cgi-bin/man?program=xorg.conf&amp;section=5"><code>xorg.conf</code></a>:
</p>

<br><p>
The RADEON driver (<a href="http://linuxreviews.org/man/radeon/"><code>man
radeon</code></a>) supports the following options for the RV280 chip (which is
found on RADEON 9200 boards).  The default values are in red:
</p>

<br><ul>
<li>
<code>Option "AGPMode" "<font color>1</font>"</code>
(driver currently supports up to x4)</li>
	<li>
<code>Option "AGPFastWrite" "<font color="red">off</font>"</code>
(only used when DRI is enabled)</li>
	<li>
<code>Option "BusType" "<strong>AGP</strong>"</code>
(if driver's bus type detection is wrong)</li>
	<li>
<code>Option "DisplayPriority" "<font color="red">AUTO</font>"</code>
(set to <code>"BIOS"</code> or <code>"HIGH"</code> to fix tearing)</li>
	<li>
<code>Option "EnablePageFlip" "<font color="red">off</font>"</code>
(turn <code>"on"</code> 3D page flipping for better performance)</li>

</ul>
<br><p>
The biggest wins would come from <code>APGMode</code>
and <code>EnablePageFlip</code>.  <code>APGFastWrite</code> may
help <a href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/FrontPage">DRI</a>.  <code>DisplayPriority</code>
may help KDE.  Don't use <code>BusType</code> unless the log shows the driver
has selected a PCI bus for the card...
</p>

<br><p>
<em>Note</em>:- when playing with Xorg 6.5 I got X crashes
with <code>EnablePageFlip</code> turned on.
