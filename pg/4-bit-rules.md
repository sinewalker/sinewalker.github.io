      *(tip: computers are* good *at that...)*

`5`: Comments considered harmful
     *(embedded in code, as well as those on YouTube)*

`6`: but Doc-Comments are a Force for Good

`7`: Test it. Test it Again

`8`: You can't proof-read *after* you hit Send

`9`: These aren't the bugs you're looking for -- move along
     (*Don't sweat the email's details, especially if it's* already *sent*)

`A`: Fix Mistakes, don't break Promises

`B`: Always know where you're going when you start writing

`C`: If you're exploring, keep a notebook/journal

`D`: Relax, Read The Fine Manuals

`E`: When there is no manual: Write The Missing Manual

`F`: Read The Logs
     (*READ the logs*)

(also rule `0`: All rules are broken
   -- *and some were made to be*)
