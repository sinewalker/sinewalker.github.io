Over the years I have found a handful of rules to work by when
Computing. Some people have lots and lots of rules but I'm a simple
bloke, and can carry only about 4-bits worth in my head.

None of these rules are my own invention. They are others' tips and
advice, received and honed over about 30 years' experience in
computing, since I began it as a hobby in primary school in the
1980's.  Some of these rules are *also* applicable to Real Life. They
are deliberately laconic (to make them easier to remember); I will
[blog about them](/tags/4-bit-rules.html)  to expand and explain &mdash; especially the
controversial-sounding ones like Rules 5 and 6.

`salt:` These are computing rules that *I* work by and recommend to
others, though you should feel free to adopt only what you like,
keeping Rule 0 in mind.

----

`0`: All rules are broken
     &mdash; *and some were made to be*

`1`: The *First Law*: Nothing works *First* time
     &mdash; *Peter Lukes, Amstrad Computer User magazine, Issue 32, September 1987*

`2`: Don't Repeat Yourself
      *(tip: computers are* good *at that&hellip;)*

`3`: `python <(echo import this)`
      *(Python [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/))*

`4`: If you're exploring, keep a notebook/journal

`5`: Comments considered harmful
     *(embedded in code, as well as those on YouTube)*

`6`: but Doc-Comments are a Force for Good

`7`: Test it. Test it Again

`8`: You can't proof-read *after* you hit Send

`9`: These aren't the bugs you're looking for &mdash; move along
     *(Pretty good is better than perfect)*

`A`: Fix Mistakes, don't break Promises

`B`: You Ain't Gonna Need It

`C`: Always know where you're going when you start writing

`D`: DON'T PANIC, Read The Fine Manuals

`E`: When there is no manual: Write The Missing Manual

`F`: Read The Logs
     (*READ the logs*)
