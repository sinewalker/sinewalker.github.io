# Introductions

My name is Mike Lockhart, and this is my web log.  I am a web sysop for a well
known Australian Open Source web content management company.  I do mainly Linux
and [Matrix](http://www.squiz.net/au/platform/matrix) work, and dabble in some
other languages and projects in my [Copious Free
Time](/jargon/html/C/copious-free-time.html).

I'm also married for 20 years and we are parents to three boys aged between 6
and 13 years.  We live in [Tasmania](http://discovertasmania.com.au), where we
grew up, returning here from New South Wales, in late 2013.  I feel grateful to
be living here, with family close at hand and an awesome, friendly and welcoming
community around us.

On the Net, I go by the handle *sinewalker*, and while after more than 20 years
I think I've outgrown it, it's still a [fairly unique
username](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sinewalker) in most places.  A newer handle
I'm adopting is *milohax*.

My ACIC background check is held at
[CVCheck](http://ww1.cvcheck.com/go/y4XPc63).

## What am I into?

I have eclectic tastes, you can read [a list that I
maintain](/pg/preferences.html), if it interests you.

This web
----

> On this web site you will find posts, pages, pictures and code that are in
> connection with my interests.  I try to keep the stuff here as general as
> possible &mdash; any work-specific writings live behind a company firewall.
> This means that what you see and read here is (or *was*) my own opinion and
> does not necessarily reflect the opinions or directions of my employers (past,
> present or future).

This is the third iteration of my blog. The [archive](/archive/archive.html) has
old posts that I've migrated from [blogger](http://sinewalker.blogspot.com.au/)
and [wordpress](https://sinewalker.wordpress.com/), though those are still
online to be read in their original form.

A major reason for building my blog with a static web page generator is so that
I can have fine control over type-setting.  While this site is mainly a personal
blog (so it's informal), I use notational conventions throughout.  These are
common enough in online technical writings for the computer field but weirdly
not well supported by systems such as Blogger or Wordpress (or Matrix) which you
must fight against to follow:

 * computer keywords are typed inline `like this`,
 * terms and variables are italicised *like that*, and
 * code blocks use *Colour Syntax Highlightng*.  At least for the newer posts
   since late 2015.

You will notice that the English on this site follows Commonwealth conventions
of grammar and spelling.  That's a natural consequence of where I live.  You
will also notice frequent spelling errors which are *not* attributable to
Commonwealth English &mdash; that's a consequence of [Rule
9](/pg/4-bit-rules.html).  I've also recently adopted the [Oxford
Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) for its clarity and
consistency.

Contacting me
----

This is not a "web 2.0" site: [there are no comments enabled
here](/blog/2015/4-bit-rules-of-computing-part-2.html).  No-one comments anyway,
and it adds a lot to the site load time and bandwidth.  There's not much point
in costing visitors that overhead for something that isn't used.

Instead you should feel free to tweet me
[@milo_hax](https://twitter.com/milo_hax), follow me [on
GitHub](https://github.com/sinewalker) or by
[e-mail](mailto:sinewalker@gmail.com), to share your thoughts.  Sensitive data
may be emailed to me using my public PGP key with fingerprint
[3CCA2E6EBCBE8795](https://keybase.io/sinewalker/key.asc).

While I do have a Facebook identity, please consider [following me on
Keybase](https://keybase.io/sinewalker/) instead.  I prefer this method over the
others, as it is the easiest way I know about to share things privately for
free, with PGP cipher keys that you can validate for yourself by various Net
handles.  No need for the broken "web of trust".

How this web site is made
----

Posts are typed using the [Dvorak keyboard](/tags/dvorak.html) layout into
[Emacs](/tags/emacs.html) on either an Apple PowerBook Mac, or a home-made
computer running [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org), on a [Sun Type 6
keyboard](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Sun_Type_6) (grey version, with
rearranged key caps).

Posts are generated from a mix of markup languages (typically
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or
[iPython](http://ipython.org/) [Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)), using the
[Nikola](http://getnikola.com) static web site and blog generator, and published
to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (via Nikola's `github_deploy`
command).  The site is reachable via my own DNS, or the GitHub one:
[http://sinewalker.github.com](http://sinewalker.github.com).

The [source markup](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/tree/src)
files and Nikola
[configuration](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/blob/src/conf.py)
are stored in my [GHP
repository](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io) on the `src`
branch.

The repository [wiki](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/wiki)
and [issues log](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/issues?q=)
are where I keep notes about the site itself, rather than fill this site with
[meta-blog](/tags/meta.html) posts.
