## An Ode to Systemd Binary Journal Files

> Sung to "Rawhide" (Blues Brothers) <br/>
> &mdash; with apologies to Ned Washington, and Frankie Laine

```text
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Raw bytes!

Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
Though the discs are swollen
Keep them log files rollin'
Raw bytes!
Through curl and phish and buffer
Hell-bent for leather
Wishin' my vile was by my side.
All the things I'm missin'
Good logfiles, tools, and streamin'
Are waiting at the end of my ride.

CHORUS
Move 'em on, head 'em up
Head 'em up, move 'em on
Move 'em on, head 'em up
Raw bytes
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in,
Ride 'em in, let 'em out,
Cut 'em out,
Ride 'em in
Raw bytes!

Keep movin', movin', movin'
Though they're disapprovin'
Keep them log files movin'
Raw bytes!
Don't try to understand 'em
Just rotate, zip, and tar 'em
Soon we'll be living high and wide.
My heartâ€™s calculatin'
My true logs will be waitin'
Be waiting at the end of my ride.

CHORUS

Raw bytes!

Raw bytes!
```
