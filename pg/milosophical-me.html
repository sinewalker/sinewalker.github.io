Welcome to my web site! This page is the seemingly obligatory "why did
I switch from &lt;insert some other blogging engine/&gt; to a static site on
GitHub Pages?" story, and also a bit of a bridge since my last regular
posts in 2012/2013

Readers who don't personally know me are probably unaware what has
happened in my personal life.  Nothing tragic has occurred, I was just
made redundant from my long-time position in a major I.T. corporation,
and it hurt. A lot. It was also a major upheaval for my family, but we
came through rather well, and I think we are in a better place – on
the whole – for it.  Certainly my new job is much, much better, and
so is our son's (soon to be sons') school. And so is our house.
</p>

<p>
In June of 2013 I was invited into HP's Sydney office for a
personal meeting – I didn't often come physically to work as I was a
telecommuter living and working from the Blue Mountains. I knew from
colleagues at work what was happening so it was no surprise what the
meeting was about: my position had become redundant and unless gainful
work could be found for me in three months, I would have to leave. HP
offered to assist in finding work internally, as well as counselling
and support for finding a position outside the company in that time.

So, you will start to see a change in my posts I think: more of the
personal,reflective/introspective kinds of posts you would expect to
read in a diary or memoir – though I am aware that basking in that
too much is boring for anyone not personally connected to me, and
potentially embarrasing for anyone else who is. So I'll see if I can
strike the right balance. I've got a few excellent examples to go on,
so I should be alright.
