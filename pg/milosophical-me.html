<p>Welcome to my web site! This page is the seemingly obligatory "why did
I switch from <code>&lt;insert some other blogging engine/&gt;</code> to a static site on
GitHub Pages?" story, and also a bit of a bridge since my last regular
posts in 2012/2013.</p>
<h3>Where have I been?</h3>
<p>Readers who don't personally know me are probably unaware what has
happened in my personal life.  Nothing tragic has occurred, or
particularly major in perspective, really.  Only that I was made
redundant from my long-time position in a major I.T. corporation, and
it hurt.  The shock of suddenly having no sure income, and with four
dependants and a mortgage was pretty stressful too. </p>
<p>In June of 2013 I was invited into HP's Sydney office for a
personal meeting — I didn't often come physically to work as I was a
telecommuter living and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.497711257701.272490.685372701&amp;type=1&amp;l=74e24db6bd">working from the Blue Mountains</a>. I knew from
colleagues at work what was happening, so it was no surprise what the
meeting was about: my position had become redundant and unless gainful
work could be found for me in three months, I would have to leave. HP
offered to assist in finding work internally, as well as counselling
and support for finding a position outside the company in that time.</p>
<p>The whole redundancy experience is overwhelming. I'm still
adjusting. The worst is missing my old home, my work colleagues and
friends. Also the uncertainty and anxiety. The <strong>best</strong> was <em>being</em>
<em>offered a new position by phone in August 2013, just as I was being</em>
<em>escorted out of the building after my exit interview at my old job!</em></p>
<p>The other good news is that I got a large redundancy package, and with
it we were able to finance a return to Tasmania!</p>
<h3>Why Tasmania?</h3>
<p>Well, both Jenny and I grew up in north Tassie, and we both have
family there (I also have some aunts and my sister in Hobart).  So
when I was looking for new work, and seeing that most of the
opportunities available "near" our Blue Mountains home were in Sydney
<em>proper</em> — with a 2 hour commute in each direction between the CBD and
home — I decided to cast a wider net and see what jobs were on offer
in Hobart.</p>
<p>I applied for a couple of positions that looked promising and happily
landed the one that I <em>really, really</em> wanted.  The PD was very
seductive and fit my own strengths perfectly.  So, pack up, sell the
house and off we go to Tasmania!</p>
<p>It was a major upheaval for the family with an interstate move, new
school for our eldest son, moving away from friends and community
connections.  When we got here, we were living in a caravan park
before finding a house to rent and hunt for a new home to buy.  There
were many hurdles and it took until June 2014 before we had a new
permanent home (and permanent job). But we came through rather well,
and I think we are in a better place — on the whole — for it.
Certainly my new job is much, much better, and so is our sons'
school. We are making new friends. And our new house is awesome.</p>
<h3>Time for reflections</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see
   the place you came from with new eyes and extra colors. And the
   people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you
   started is not the same as never leaving.</p>
<p>— Terry Pratchett, <em>A Hat Full of Sky</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new role in Hobart is a return to home in more than one sense. Yes
I've come home to Tassie, but also I think I've finally found the role
I'm suited for. For years at EDS/HP I tried to be a developer, because
I love the technical. I could never quite land the role I wanted or
hold onto the opportunities that did come my way though, and the few
times I did get to <em>write code</em>, it was last-minute fire-fighting that
turned into a lights-on support role after the project "went live" and
the developers all moved on to new projects — leaving me and a few
others to hold the fort. Our reward for saving the project.</p>
<p>With the redundancy though, I was forced to take a look inward, at
what I had and had not achieved in my career, where I am strongest and
what I enjoy doing. It turns out I'm not a developer, and I'm okay
with that. <strong>What I do well, and have done for my whole career, is</strong>
<strong>integration, teaching and</strong> "<strong>engaging people</strong>". I've been doing "dev-ops"
since before there was a movement about it; being the connection point
between the aloof developers and the grumpy sys-admins, and making
parts and people fit together. And also between the business managers
and the IT managers, business analysts and my clients' customers (or
"end-users" as our industry lovingly calls them). So when the job
description popped up for the role at Squiz, it seemed to fit like a
glove. Clearly the Squiz HR managers felt the same.</p>
<p>As I write this in early 2015, I've been here at <a href="http://www.squiz.net">Squiz</a> for about 18
months. The honeymoon is over and I've seen the warts, but
<a href="http://www.squiz.net/au/careers">this place is awesome</a>, with such potential both as a company and for me
personally. I really am not only relieved, but excited to have received
permanency here. Every day I come (physically) to work, I am
surrounded by fantastic peers who challenge me and I reaffirm that I'm
in the right place at last.</p>
<h3>Appreciating where I am</h3>
<p>The return to Tasmania is a welcome sea-change too. Yes, we are
missing the events and travel opportunities in and around Sydney, and
I miss our Blue Mountains home (and my tae kwon do club). But Tassie
has it's own events and stuff that <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/best-in-travel/regions/04-tasmania">draws people from all over the
world</a>.
We love the life style here. We also like having family closer —
something we've not had for 15 years while living in New South Wales
and nine years of raising children.</p>
<p>Also, we can finally travel to places <strong>other</strong> <em>than</em> Tasmania for
biannual our big summer trips ;-)</p>
<h3>Milosophy</h3>
<p>(Mike's philosophy)</p>
<p>The latter part of 2013 and the year 2014 have been stressful, jubilant, hectic,
emotional, anxious, challenging, fulfilling.  I was working hard in my
career and in family life, not having (or taking?) a lot of time for
personal reflection. In early 2015 I finally took some extended annual
leave (two weeks) which gave me the time to focus on our home, our
family, and myself.  This page is part of the return on that introspective
investment, but of course there is much else beyond what I will
publicly expose.</p>
<p>Beyond the technical topics, for this site I feel there will be more
value for myself and any readers I have if I use this as an
opportunity for personal reflection, as well as documenting and
exploring technical topics. More Zen, more Tao, but hopefully still no
bull.</p>
<p>So, you will start to see a change in my posts I think: more of the
personal,reflective/introspective kinds of posts you would expect to
read in a diary or memoir — though I am aware that basking in that
too much is boring for anyone not personally connected to me, and
potentially embarrassing for anyone else who is. So I'll see if I can
strike the right balance. I've got <a href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com">a few</a> <a href="http://technomancy.us">excellent</a>
<a href="http://sachachua.com">examples</a> to go on,
so I <a href="http://technicalblogging.com">should be alright</a>.</p>
<h3>Milosophical Me</h3>
<p>There are technical reasons for my move away from <a href="http://sinewalker.wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> as a
blogging platform — it's slow and awkward to use (meaning I'm
discouraged from blogging with it and focus on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MichaelLockhart">microblogging</a> instead),
convoluted to host and maintain for yourself, limited when hosted for
free, and anyway dynamic pages built from databases are a silly waste
of processor cycles when your site is mainly static, content-heavy pages,
like a blog.</p>
<p>Now that I'm in a web company, I want to hack with HTML/CSS/JavaScript
(or <a href="http://clojure.org/clojurescript">languages</a> that <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">compile</a> to Javascript), and I need a place to
publish <a href="../hax/matrix-rain/matrix.html">hacks</a>, and <a href="../pixels/">pictures</a>. With a static site I can have my cake and
eat it: I have a templating/publishing framework for making blogging
quick and painless when I need it to be, as well as being able to
side-step it when I want full control over the web codes.  Plus I've
finally bought a domain name, so that I won't be flitting all over the
place in future, even if I decide to host somewhere other that GitHub,
or use some other blogging framework than Nikola.</p>
<p>I begin 2015 in high hopes for my personal and online future. </p>
