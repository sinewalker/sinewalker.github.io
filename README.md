Personal public blog using Github Pages

At present the raw input to this is on a [BitBucket Mercurial repo](https://bitbucket.org/sinewalker/blog/src) but 
this will soon change to the standard Github Pages practice of maintaning a separate branch for the source, with the actual
web site on the master branch.

I'm just not there, yet.
