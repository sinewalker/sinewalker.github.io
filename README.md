## Milosophical Me - src branch

This is my personal web site and blog.  In this `src` branch are the source input files that make up the blog, the actual web site as served by Github Pages is on the `master` branch.

The site is generated using the [Nikola](https://getnikola.com) static blog generator. The site is deployed to github pages using Nikola's `github_deploy` mechanism.

There are some parts of the site which are *not* under Nikola's control:

 * `/hax`  <-- web hacks that are built from other projects (some in github, some elsewhere) and deployed to the master branch manually)
 * `/jargon`  <-- A mirror of The Jargon File (New Hacker's Dictionary). Also deployed to `master` manually.
 
Refer to this repository's wiki for details about how the site works and how to maintain it.  I also use the Issues register to keep track of what needs special attention.
