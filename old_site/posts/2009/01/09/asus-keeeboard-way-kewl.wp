It looks so much like my first ever computer (an <a title="Amstrad CPC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_cpc">Amstrad CPC 6128</a>). Check it out:

It also has some really neat features. I hope it gets marketed, I want one! Especially if it boots in under a second like the old 8-bit machines. I remember when the computer was ready before the CRT had even finished warming up... those were the days.
