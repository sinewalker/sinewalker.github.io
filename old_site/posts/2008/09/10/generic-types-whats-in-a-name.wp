<p>I've been stumbling over Java's generic types for a while now... I think I
finally understand what my problem is:
</p>
<br/>
<p style="text-align:center;">They should be called <strong>specific </strong>types, or <em><span>parametrised</span></em>-<em>collections</em>!</p>
<br/>

I think the feature is called "Java generics" because when you use a collection, say <code>List&lt;E&gt;</code>, that <code>List</code> contains elements of parameterised type <code>&lt;E&gt;</code>, a "generic type".  But the element type in the plain old-fashioned non-parametrised collection <code>List</code> is also generic!  In fact the non-parametrised <code>List</code> is more <em>generic</em> than the "generic" version (it can contain elements of <em>any</em> sub-class of <code>Object</code>)!  The distinction is that the elements in a <code>List&lt;String&gt;</code> are all of one <strong>specific</strong> type (<code>String</code>), whereas the elements in a <code>List</code> can be of any general type, and can even be of different types in the same <code>List</code> collection (leading to problems that "Java generics" was invented to address).

<span><code>&lt;sarcasm&gt;</code>Gosh, what an epiphany.<code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code></span>

<p>If you're a Java guru this is nothing new, of course. But that took
  me <strong>ages</strong> to grasp. I think I wasn't helped by the
  terminology. In fact whenever I'm reading Java literature, it helps if I swap
  "generic" for "specific".  This makes much more sense to me. Actually I
  already do word substitutions for much of the Java canon.  For instance:</p>

<br/>

<ul>
	<li>"class Foo is instantiated"<br/>
Translation: "a Foo object is created"</li>
	<li>"invoke method X of class Y"<br/>
Translation: "send message X to a Y object",<br/>
or even "send class Y the X message"</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<span>Probably the Java literature is strictly more "correct" or explicit, but it'd be much more clear and concise if people used the older <span>OOP</span> words for things...</span></body></html>
