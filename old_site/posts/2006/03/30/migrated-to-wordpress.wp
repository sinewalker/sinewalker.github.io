<p>Well, here is the new Wordpress version of my blog!</p>

<br/>

<p>
So far, I'm pretty impressed with Wordpress.  The code is much cleaner than
Blogger, its post editor is far superior too.  I love the Categories, they work
much easier than the Blogger + Delicious kludge I had at <a title="My old blog
                                                                   site"
                                                            href="http://sinewalker.blogspot.com">my
    old blog</a>.</p>

<!-- TEASER_END -->

<p>The standard templates mostly have the same issue as Blogger — they are fixed-width columns for the most part.  I <em>hate</em> that!  I'll have to figure out how to change templates here too (or, migrate from the Wordpress.com hosting site to my ISP's hosting site, which I may yet do…)</p>

<br/>

<p>
In the mean-time, I'll stick with one of the standard templates. This template I've found at least is variable-width — so the blog takes up all of your browser's window width — but I'm not keen on the white background. Oh well, it'll do until I get my own wordpress running.</p></body></html>
