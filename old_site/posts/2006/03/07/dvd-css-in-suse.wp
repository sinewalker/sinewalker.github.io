<p>There
are <a href="http://softwareinreview.com/cms/content/view/2/1/">excellent
instructions</a> for installing/patching SUSE to play commercial
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-scrambling_system">CSS</a>
encrypted) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD">DVD</a>s.  I had no
trouble following them either.  Wonder of wonders.

The whole issue
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libdvdcss">libdvdcss</a> being
“illegal”
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act">DMCA</a>-<a href="http://www.fta.gov.au/default.aspx?FolderID=246">enlisted</a>
countries <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=174995&cid=14552396">seems
to be mute</a> now, from my perspective...  so long as your intent is only to
watch movies that you have legally obtained (and not fincancial gain), then it
should be fine — if it's good enough for the MPAA, then it's good enough for
me.  This would seem to me to work well with Australia's existing copyright
law, which specifically grants fair-use copying and playing anyway, and goes
against the dogma of the DMCA.</p></body></html>
