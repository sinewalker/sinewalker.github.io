<p>Once again, Microsoft have <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/uioverview.mspx">drastically changed their Office interface</a>.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
While the new interface is very nice eye-candy and probably has some new features that could help (arguably), it represents yet another need to re-train.
</p>

<br/>


<p>
The old argument that <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">OpenOffice </a>is too different from <a href="http://office.microsoft.com">MS-Office</a> to be quickly useable has just vanished.  <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT8171250759.html">OpenOffice is more like MS-Office 97</a> than MS-Office 2007 will be, and really, who has needed any of the features in Office XP or Office 2003?  What were they, againâ€¦?  Oh yeah, anoying interface changes, and removal of the stupid Paperclip.

I think I'll be distributing my work documents in PDF, created by OOo now, except where I must absolutely use MSO documents for work.  Everthing else will be OOo.  Now I just need to convince my wife that it's not worth continually purchasing MSO, or even having it on our home PC.</p></body></html>
