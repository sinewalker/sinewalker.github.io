<html><body><p>When you first install cygwin and run bash, it'll usually display this error message:
</p><blockquote>

<pre>Your group is currently "mkpasswd".  This indicates that

the /etc/passwd (and possibly /etc/group) files should be rebuilt.

See the man pages for mkpasswd and mkgroup then, for example, run

mkpasswd -l [-d] &gt; /etc/passwd

mkgroup  -l [-d] &gt; /etc/group

Note that the -d switch is necessary for domain users.</pre>

<!-- TEASER_END -->If you happen to be in a corporate environment with a huge active directory, then the <code>mkpasswd</code><sub>(1)</sub> command can take a very long time.  A quicker way to fix this issue (provided only the current user uses cygwin on this machine, which is most likely) is to issue this command instead:

<blockquote>

<pre>mkpasswd -l -c &gt; /etc/passwd; mkgroup -l -d &gt; /etc/group</pre>

</blockquote>

The <code>mkgroup</code><sub>(1)</sub> command will still take a few minutes to complete, but typically there are much fewer groups than users, so it's bearable.</body></html>
