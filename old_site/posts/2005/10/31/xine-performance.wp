<p>Now playing with <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> as my latest
Linux of choice (I got fed up with RPM dependancy problems, and Gentoo being
source-based solves my other issue with binary-based distributions, where I
felt like a 2nd-class citizen when using or accessing source code).
</p>

<br/>

<p>
So, I've got <a href="http://xinehq.de/">Xine</a> working, but can only use
shared memory for the video decoding.  This is great if I want to capture
screen shots, but not for high-speed movies such as The Matrix, or even just
reading the credits on The Lord of the Ring.  So need to "fix" the performance.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
I used to have Mandrake
running <a href="http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Main_Page">v4l</a>
+ <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/video-playback.html">xv</a>,
but I can't have installed it right in Gentoo because, although xv is loaded,
the performance is glacial if I try to use it.
</p>

<p>
I
found <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/xine-howto/en_GB/html/howto-9.html">this
old How-to</a> with some advice to try... but I might also want to look at
the <a href="http://xinehq.de/index.php/faq">FAQ</a>.... probably I haven't
built something into the kernel.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
Also while reading around, I
discovered <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">Mplayer</a>.  This looks
like it's worth a download...</p>
