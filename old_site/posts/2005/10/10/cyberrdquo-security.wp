I wish USA would stop calling it “cyber security”.  It's just stupid. The word
“cyber” was coined by AI researchers for the ability of computers to interact
with humans, either via a human interface, or by acting human. Later, it turned
more towards embedding computers into humans as a form of prosthetic (a la
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_Million_Dollar_Man">$6 millon
man</a>”) or to build composite computer-humans
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">cyborg</a>).

Lately I think the US “cyber security” push has one of these aims:
</p>

<br/>

<ul>
  <li>To control cyborg's access to the net?</li>
  <li>To curb “cyberterrorism” — the attack on America by those cyborgs?</li>
  <li>To promote safe use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics">teledildonics </a>within federal agencies, a sort of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Lewinski">Monica Lewinsky</a>” protocol aimed at avoiding future political embarrasments.</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>
Obviously, the most likely of these is the third aim… ;-)
