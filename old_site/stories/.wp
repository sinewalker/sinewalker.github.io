<html><body><p>Welcome to my home on the web.  I'm a computer systems engineer working in Hobart, but this place is not about that.  It's a place for me to record random musings I have throughout the day, and to store tid-bits of info I pick up in my virtual travels.


You can email me:  sinewalker at gmail dot comÂ  Or, you may see me about on freenode (I visit #kde, #plasma, and #suse most often):  sinewalker



<strong>Update - 20130811:</strong>  I intend to move this blog to github pages soon.  At that point this site will remain online in read-only mode and there will be links to the same content on the new site. Until then, feel free to add comments.</p></body></html>
