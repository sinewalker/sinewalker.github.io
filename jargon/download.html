<h1 class="centered">Access to the File</h1>

<p>The Jargon File is available for browsing <a href="html/index-2.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>You can download an installable HTML <a
href="jargon-4.4.7.tar.gz">tarball</a> from here.</p>

<p>You can browse the <a href="changes.html">recent changes</a>.
Entries with only trivial changes (spelling, punctuation, references, minor
changes of phrasing) have been omitted from the change list. </p>

<p>Text versions of the File are available through a <a
href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/">historically appropriate
    interface</a>. [and a <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sinewalker/jargon/src/f39813682526c66f1802b3b1bb9d11203cc7ae65/www.catb.org/_esr/jargon/oldversions/?at=default">file listing</a> on my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/sinewalker/jargon">Bitbucket repository</a> -- M. Lockhart]</p>

<p>You can also download a copy of the Jargon File <a
href="jargsrc.tar.gz">masters and the production tools</a> used to generate
HTML and TeX versions.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also look at the entries that have been <a
href="chaff.html">deleted</a> from the File over the years.</p>

<p>Requests that we email the File will be ignored. Also note that the
info version has been phased out; it's an HTML world now.</p>

<h1>Why There Are No diff Files</h1>

<p>Many people have asked why I don't release diff files for new versions, so
people can avoid having to fetch the whole thing each time. It's because
diffs tend to lose the actual semantic changes in a lot of noise resulting
from very low-level tweaks (typo fixes, re-justifications, etc.). This bulks
the diffs up to the point where I don't think they're enough smaller than the
File itself to justify the hassle costs of issuing or using them.</p>
