<html><body><p>Quick note:-  I use <a title="K[ewl] Desktop Environment" href="http://www.kde.org">KDE</a> nearly all the time.  But sometimes I have occasion for a minimal desktop (e.g. when I plan to use just one, heavy program like <a title="FlightGear Flight Simulator" href="http://www.flightgear.org/">FlightGear</a> and need basically not much more than a window manager and X itself).  So an alternate "light" desktop session type is nice to have.

    <p>There is the <a title="Xubuntu Linux" href="http://www.xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a> distribution of ubuntu, which uses <a title="Xfce home" href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce</a>.  But I don't need to switch my whole linux install over.  It's easy to add Xfce to an installed Kubuntu (or Ubuntu):</p>

I got this incantation from <a title="Installing Xfce on Ubuntu" href="http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/xubuntu">over here</a>. This adds the packages for Xfce and puts a new session into your display manager's Session Type menu.  If you had kubuntu or xubuntu and wanted GNOME as well you could install GNOME into either of them with the <code>gnome-desktop-environment</code> master package, I suppose. GNOME isn't my cup of tea.

<p>
I haven't played with <code>aptitude</code> yet, but you could substite <code>agt-get</code> for it in the commands above too I guess.

<p>
Yes, I know, Xfce is more than a window manager; it also has it's own file manager, terminal program, and so on.  But the main feature is that it's <em>fast </em>and <em>small</em>, which matters most to me for it's purpose on my system.

<p>
Since [k|x|ed]ubuntu is <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/ubuntustory">built upon</a> <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, all the documentation describing Debian packaging and tools (<code>dpkg</code>, <code>apt-get</code>, <code>apt-cache</code>, <code>aptitude</code>, <code>dselect</code> and so on) can be found at their site.  The <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/apt-howto/">APT HOWTO</a> is also probably a good place to startâ€¦</p></body></html>
