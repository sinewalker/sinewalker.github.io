<html><body><p>I spotted a "Vista compatable" keyboard in K-Mart the other day, which set me thinking... what would a Vista keyboard actually <em>do</em> that a "non-Vista" keyboard can't?


Then I Googled for "Microsoft Keyboard Vista" and found <a title="Vista media keyboard??? (Microsoft)" href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=080">this ad from Microsoft</a> (<a title="Vista media keyboard??? (Google cache)" href="http://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:tFfrA9Y1WiEJ:www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx%3Fpid%3D080+microsoft+keyboard+vista&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=2&amp;gl=au&amp;client=firefox-a">Google Cache</a>).



What the?  "Designed to make it easier than ever to control PC media from your desk, your lap–or even from the comfort of your couch".  So… if I use this keyboard's Play button to try and play media that Vista's <a title="Digital Rights Management (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management">DRM</a> system <em>thinks </em>I shouldn't be playing, does it administer an electric shock?  What if I have the keyboard in my lap :-D  Ouch! No so <em>comfortable </em>now…



Thanks, Microsoft, but … ahem, <em>no thanks</em>!</p></body></html>
