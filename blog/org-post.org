** Header 2

Here's a post I made using Emacs' Org-mode (I have installed org
version 8.2 using ELPA).

Let's see if it compiles.

*** some in-line code:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def mypython_func():
    '''
     here's some python code
    '''
     print('hello')


if __name__ = '__main__':
    mypython_func

#+END_SRC

I wonder how that appears?  I guess I'll find out.

I don't like those red boxes around the quotes...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(let* ((htmlize-dir "~/.emacs.d/elpa/htmlize-20130207.1202"))
  (when (file-directory-p htmlize-dir)
    (add-to-list 'load-path htmlize-dir)
    (require 'htmlize)))
#+END_SRC
