Take a little good advice

Take a trip to paradise

It's really not too hard to find

If you've got it in you mind.

It's whatever turns you on.......

Goodies.........Goodies.........

It's anything you want it to be

A record or an O.B.E.

A circus or a seaside pier

We make it happen here

Fun for all the family......

Goodies........Goodies........

Goodies, goody goody yum yum

Ahhh.
