The old Chinese curse: *may you live in interesting times* seems to have struck
us. I haven't written in a while, sorry. I guess this year's been a bit of a
downer, with all the horrible things going on in the world.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

The Australian people decided to vote to keep the backwards conservative
coalition again. Forget about the planet, the country's economy or our future.
Forget about freedom of the press, or high-speed internet (which would help with
our growing transportation issues).  Forget our nearest neighbor countries who
face general flooding caused by global climate change, while our government
approves a new coal mine for the sake of 100 permanent jobs.  Forget about
decent human values, basically. But at least they "stopped the boats". Hah,
stopped reporting about them, we still turn them back. How good is that?  How
good is record floods and drought? How good is that fire in the Blue Mountains,
or the ones we had in Tasmania this Summer? How good is 12MBit internet? How
good is housing and hopsitals in Hobart? How good are our schools?

Christchurch.  What a horrible thing to happen in the best country in the world.

Brexit.  It'd be laughable, a comedy sketch better than anything from the Python
Troupe, if it weren't also so disguistingly racist, driven by fear again, and
fanned by the Murdocracy - indeed now their Prime Minister is a former Murdoch
mogul.

Still more shootings in America, continued war in the Middle East, now a new oil
crisis...

The Amazon is on fire.  The Great Barrier Reef will get run-off from that new
coal mine.

I worry for my kids future. I have a very negative outlook, I think we've missed
our opportunity to fix any of it.

So yeah, a bit unmotivated to be honest.
