<p>Well, my flirtations with gentoo didn't last too long.  I'm now trying SuSE 10.0 out, which — yes — is an RPM-based distro!
</p>
 
<br><p>
So, why did I leave gentoo? I suppose that the "distro that doesn't get in your way" got in my way. With the arrival of our first baby, I'm rather short on the hours needed to learn how to configure everything in gentoo. While it's true that I could stand to learn a lot from getting it all to work, I can't afford to be hacking around getting pesky things like the scanner to go, or printing, or figuring out why I suddenly cannot burn a CD anymore. I need a "linux for dummies" that just works, and is more stable than winblows. Of course, if money was no object, I'd get myself a nice shiny new dual G5 Macintosh, but that's just for my dreams.
</p>

<br><p>
So, since Novel have decided to open up SuSE a bit more now, I'm trying it out. I downloaded the "Evaluation" version, rather than OpenSuse, since I'm not an OpenSource zealot, and frankly I'd like to visit web sites with flash animations. It has crippled xine/kaffeine and no DVDCSS, but I can live without movies for now until I get that sorted, or build from the source I have, or even (ick!) just boot to Windows (though I know of no free DVD players for win32 that expand a 16:9 movie to fill as much of my 4:3 screen as Kaffeine does).
</p>

<br><p>
So, it installed well, I now have working scanner, printer, cd-rw, dhcpd, cvs, mysql, java (yay!), apache, tomcat, kde. No Audacity or Rosegarden (important apps for me), no Eclipse (can wait). Slightly out-of-date jedit (4.1) and about 250MB of patches to upgrade to at some point, or not, since on dial-up I'm not exactly a cracker target...
</p>

<br><p>
I'm very happy with SuSE so far. It's as pleasant as I always thought it would be. YaST is nice too. Only problem: sometimes cdrecord bombs, still (!). Pisses me off, it worked once but not again, even as root. It can sit on the back-burner (oops) until after I've got my missing audio software installed
</p>

<br><p>
Major projects for linux are:
</p>

<br><ul>
<li>Record old music tapes to OGG and burn to data and audio CDs</li>
	<li>Get nice video editing software (kino) working for baby and burn to VCDs</li>
	<li>Java hacking (install Sun Java Studio sharchives)</li>
	<li>Photo indexing and database, then archive to CDs</li>
	<li>Produce a CD database</li>
	<li>Get a working backup solution running</li>
</ul>
<br><p>
Obviously, I need to get cd-rw sorted as a priority... it's kinda central!</p>

  newspapers</em>
</p>
<br><p>Why does "mainstream media" think blogging is such a huge hit? It's not that
Internet is immediate, or that anyone can do it (which has big down-sides as
well as it's egalitarian advantages). It is simply that people everywhere are
fed-up with WWII-era propagandists telling us what to believe and have started
researching it for themselves.</p>

<br><p>
This is the Information Revolution: the Revolution is greatly improved access
to the information. People are more educated now than they were 50 or even 20
years ago and can make informed judgements. They don't need some "journalist"
to do it for them. This is quite appart form the fact that today's journalism
is extremely poor compared to yester-year's.
</p>

<br><p>
I don't buy papers because I know that I can't trust them to bring me news in
an unbiased, non-politically or commercially influenced fashion, or full of
Tabloid rubbish like British newspapers. I accept the risk that the news I
learn via the Net can be from the "uninformed" masses and mitigate this by
using many sources so I can judge for myself where the "truth" lies.
</p>

<br><p>
I won't even read over people's shoulders anymore.
</p>

<br><p>
For at least the last 10 years, newspapers have been good for only one thing:
the ink used in newspaper presses is fantastic for removing streaks and smudges
from my computer monitor!</p>

<p>Now playing with <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> as my latest
Linux of choice (I got fed up with RPM dependancy problems, and Gentoo being
source-based solves my other issue with binary-based distributions, where I
felt like a 2nd-class citizen when using or accessing source code).
</p>

<br><p>
So, I've got <a href="http://xinehq.de/">Xine</a> working, but can only use
shared memory for the video decoding.  This is great if I want to capture
screen shots, but not for high-speed movies such as The Matrix, or even just
reading the credits on The Lord of the Ring.  So need to "fix" the performance.
</p>

<br><p>
I used to have Mandrake
running <a href="http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Main_Page">v4l</a>
+ <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/video-playback.html">xv</a>,
but I can't have installed it right in Gentoo because, although xv is loaded,
the performance is glacial if I try to use it.
</p>

<br><p>
I
found <a href="http://dvd.sourceforge.net/xine-howto/en_GB/html/howto-9.html">this
old How-to</a> with some advice to try... but I might also want to look at
the <a href="http://xinehq.de/index.php/faq">FAQ</a>.... probably I haven't
built something into the kernel.
</p>

<br><p>
Also while reading around, I
discovered <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">Mplayer</a>.  This looks
like it's worth a download...</p>

<blockquote><em> The great thing about Linux is that all the definitive
documentation (including the source code) comes with the OS. </em></blockquote>
<p>
(<a href="http://books.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=166454&amp;threshold=-1&amp;commentsort=0&amp;mode=thread&amp;cid=13883477">Slashdot quote</a>)
</p>
<br><p>
You know, I'm finding that for a lot of the “beginner” linux distro's, this is
not true.  Yes, the source is <em>available</em> but it doesn't <em>come with
the OS</em>.</p>

<br><p>
Granted, not everyone wants to fill their harddrives with source tarballs or
SRPMs on the off chance they might want to read them, but only a few distro's I
know come with source, and those are not necessarily for noob's. the main
example that comes to mind is Gentoo (since it's a “ports”-like
distribution). This is not to wax lyrical on the benefits of Gentoo for
learning Linux (Gentoo has many weaknesses in that regard too, among its
inappropriateness as a general OS for noob's), just that it's the only one I've
found where the source <em>comes with the OS</em>.
</p>

<br><p>
Other distro's with source “available” are Debian and Fedora (on extra CDs you
have to download, and Fedora locks the source into SRPMs which is another
learning hurdle to leap over, especially bad if all you want to do is read the
source comments, or documentation not included in the binary RPM). It makes me
feel like a 2nd-class citizen, that the source is somehow “open” but you have
to know the secret handshake to get at it.
</p>

<br><p>
All of this, just to say: while reading source docs is a laudable habbit and I
share your wish to encourage it, I can also see how it is difficult for most
Linux noob's to form this habbit so long as the source doesn't actually come
with the OS, which for a great many distro's it does not. The extra steps to
download (and in many cases extract from SRPMs) the source are probably enough
of a deterrent to forming this habit.
</p>

<br><p>
unfortunately, hacker habbits require hacker motivation :-(

I wish USA would stop calling it “cyber security”.  It's just stupid. The word
“cyber” was coined by AI researchers for the ability of computers to interact
with humans, either via a human interface, or by acting human. Later, it turned
more towards embedding computers into humans as a form of prosthetic (a la
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_Million_Dollar_Man">$6 millon
man</a>”) or to build composite computer-humans
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">cyborg</a>).
</p>

<br><p>
Lately I think the US “cyber security” push has one of these aims:
</p>

<br><ul>
<li>To control cyborg's access to the net?</li>
  <li>To curb “cyberterrorism” — the attack on America by those cyborgs?</li>
  <li>To promote safe use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teledildonics">teledildonics </a>within federal agencies, a sort of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Lewinski">Monica Lewinsky</a>” protocol aimed at avoiding future political embarrasments.</li>
</ul>
<br><p>
Obviously, the most likely of these is the third aim… ;-)

</p>
<br><p>Seems that RIAA are intent on sueing more 12-year old girls for sharing music... it sickens me.
</p>

<br><p>
I am not sure what to do to protest (beyond what seems to be happening already
— consumers aren't buying today's crap, and RIAA/ARIA/MPAA etc are just blaming
it on the Net anyway). I am considering what would happen if lots of fans
started writing directly to their favourite artists and asking them these
questions:

</p>

<br><ul>
<li>why do you have this deal with your distributor EMI? I can't play your
  </li>
<li>why don't you consider putting sample tracks on your web site? For that matter, why don't you deal directly with Apple, or start your own pay-per-download site for your songs? I'm sure heaps of fans like me will buy them, and you could get a much larger cut per track than Warner Bros is giving you</li>
</ul>
<br><p>
Of course, there are costs to running a web site also. But I wonder if what may
happen eventually is a return to music guilds, where a guild runs the site,
member groups contribute content and all proffit goes to the members. It would
probably be a good business to start, atracting new groups like the “Idol” TV
shows do now. Shame I have hopeless business sense though.

</p>

    
<p>I would like to see more web sites adopt meta-data labelling standards and
their presence be a factor in the ranking of the page. If more sensible pages
had been indexed, Library-Of-Congress style (or whichever standard is adopted)
then we would get many more relevant hits.
</p>

<br><p>
We would also get many people hacking the index by putting popular but
irelevant meta-data into their pages… I haven't figured this one out
yet. Perhaps if the meta-data is combined with some sort of AI that can read
the page and judge if the tags are for-real, or just to seed the search engine…
no this is far-out-future innovation stuff.</p>

<em>In reference
  to <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/18/2035235&amp;tid=190">this Slashdot question</a> about Mainframe Culture</em>
</p>
<br><p>Appart from the obvious religious stuff about GUI (or lack of) and
user-centred interfaces (or lack of), the biggest difference, and the biggest
advantage that Mainframe brings is it's culture of process and change
control. It is something you should strive to let your Mainframe masters pass
on to the *nix/windoze padawans before they die of old age.
</p>

<br><p>
I am a *nix padawan, but, crocky technology asside, I'm frequently impressed by
my Mainframe elders, their ability to deploy code to Production environments
that works *the first time* nearly every time, and their ability to
communictate technical changes necessary to fix broken code in the middle of
the night in the 0.1% of cases where they failed to get it working first time.
</p>

<br><p>
Key values that I have picked up from my masters, and which should be
inherrited by both *nix and PC/Mac enclaves are focused around Engineering
principles. Mainframe guru's program like a civil engineer builds a bridge. No
shortcuts are taken unless it can be proven that it is safe to do so. Testing
is carried out in stages and test results must be submitted with the change
request before a program migrates to Production. If a program must “abend”
(Abnormal End) then it should do so noisily and with as much information as
possible. If it finishes cleanly, little information is needed other than this
fact.
</p>

<br><p>
These closely follow the
advice <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/">Raymond</a> has encoded
in <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/taoup/html/">his book</a>, but
there is probably much more that your Mainframe gurus know that you should
cherrish and extend to your newer team members.
</p>

<br><p>
Forget about the religious wars, the technology changes and the “focus” of your
programmers on users or other programmers. Get the real truth from your
Mainframe masters who have seen it all pass before them but have learned the
hard way how to make a stable computer environment that stays up, even on
cruddy mainframe technology. If their attitudes were adopted by people fluent
in today's fantastic systems, all people would benefit.
</p>

<br><p>
The sad fact is that, in today's environment, especially after the dot-com
cowboys set Upper Management expectations, following Process is just too slow,
or too expensive. Convincing management that a bigger cost up front will result
in a lower cost in the long run is also futile when mgt sees it as “normal” for
computer systems to break. After all, their Windows machine on their desk has
been doing that for 20 years now, so it must be normal, right?
</p>

<br><p>
What matters most to managers or clients when deploying new systems these days
seems to be “time to market”, and the only consent to quality is that the IT
dept/company follows check-list processes like CMMI or ISO9000 which do not
address the real issues and put too much into the Process rather than the
Result. Also, when the system breaks, it's typically at the expense of the IT
company that built it, or was stupid enough to agree to use the off-the-shelf
product in the first place, so there is nothing to drive a change of behaviour
from the clients.</p>

<p>Place these settings in your <a href="http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/cgi-bin/man?program=xorg.conf&amp;section=5"><code>xorg.conf</code></a>:
</p>

<br><p>
The RADEON driver (<a href="http://linuxreviews.org/man/radeon/"><code>man
radeon</code></a>) supports the following options for the RV280 chip (which is
found on RADEON 9200 boards).  The default values are in red:
</p>

<br><ul>
<li>
<code>Option "AGPMode" "<font color>1</font>"</code>
(driver currently supports up to x4)</li>
	<li>
<code>Option "AGPFastWrite" "<font color="red">off</font>"</code>
(only used when DRI is enabled)</li>
	<li>
<code>Option "BusType" "<strong>AGP</strong>"</code>
(if driver's bus type detection is wrong)</li>
	<li>
<code>Option "DisplayPriority" "<font color="red">AUTO</font>"</code>
(set to <code>"BIOS"</code> or <code>"HIGH"</code> to fix tearing)</li>
	<li>
<code>Option "EnablePageFlip" "<font color="red">off</font>"</code>
(turn <code>"on"</code> 3D page flipping for better performance)</li>

</ul>
<br><p>
The biggest wins would come from <code>APGMode</code>
and <code>EnablePageFlip</code>.  <code>APGFastWrite</code> may
help <a href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/FrontPage">DRI</a>.  <code>DisplayPriority</code>
may help KDE.  Don't use <code>BusType</code> unless the log shows the driver
has selected a PCI bus for the card...
</p>

<br><p>
<em>Note</em>:- when playing with Xorg 6.5 I got X crashes
with <code>EnablePageFlip</code> turned on.
