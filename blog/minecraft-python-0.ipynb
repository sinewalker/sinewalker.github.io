The creator of RaspberryJuice, Martin O'Hanlan, has an [excellent blog](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com), and his [instructions for installing all of this and setting it up](http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2014/10/minecraft-raspberryjuice-and-canarymod.html) are clear and easy to follow.  Start there.\n",

It has a [sophisticated Permissions system](http://canarymod.net/books/canarymod-admin-guide/permissions-and-groups) and [modular configuration files](http://canarymod.net/books/canarymod-admin-guide/setting-your-server).  After you unpack it and accept the EULA (by modifying `eula.txt`), you will have a tightly locked-down Minecraft server that needs some changes to be useful for hacking with Python.\n",
      "\n",
      "The documentation is good, so far as it goes, but it seems to still be under construction.  Anyway, the configuration files are well commented, so it's simple to work out what to change just by reading them.\n",

      "I will configure my world for hacking with Python.  I want to play in Creative Mode (so I can fly, and so that there is no interference with my hacking by the mechanics of the Survival game) and also I want to be able to build with the player as well as through Python.\n",

I'm unsure why exactly, and I'm *fairly* sure I've spelt it right. I can't find what all the default permissions are to check that though (again, documentation seems unfinished). So for now at least, I'll just add my player to the `admins` group, which I note from the world config file has a `path` of `'*'` and I take that to mean \"allow All The Things!\".
