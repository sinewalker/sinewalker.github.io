    "Sometimes exploring code is like a text-adventure game.  The modules are like different rooms containing strange objects and it's not immediately clear what you should be doing next, or how to use the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a text-adventure game, you need to `LOOK` at your surroundings to get your bearings and see what objects are around; `TAKE` objects, and even `EXAMINE` them once they're in your hands to uncover their secrets.  Only then will you discover that the sword you just took has a powerful magical enscryption on it, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the code you're exploring has *doc-comments*, then you can do the same thing: you can *look* at the module's description and an overview of classes and methods; or get the coding system to *describe* an object's properties and methods, how they should be called, what behavior to expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most languages that have this facility call it [Docstrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring), which is the name LISP gave them, and (I think) where it originated.  I'm calling them \"*doc-comments*\" for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Java doesn't have docstrings, but instead has special *documentation comments*\n",
    " 2. (More important) it balances Rule 5's caution against using comments at all\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a doc-comment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like regular comments, you use these to describe the code in a natural human language, let's say English (*Solo sé un poco de Español*).  Where doc-comments are different is, they have special features that are designed to be parsed by development tools to assist programmers directly, not just to be read by human eyes and ignored by compilers or interpreters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how doc-comments address the problems I outlined with regular comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Code is the single authoritative source of truth in a program!*  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Doc-comments include supplemental information on the object being documented which, while not needed or used by a compiler or interpreter, are essential for tools that inspect code and help you to write it.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Add signposts for code-completion tools\n",
    "      * Provide the description text for pop-up tool-tips, or to generate documentation\n",
    "      * Specify expected values for parameters, not just the data type\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *There is no way to ensure that code comments are correct at all\n",
    "  times (they're not always updated with code changes, and they can't\n",
    "  be covered by unit tests)*\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Some doc-comments *can include unit test cases*, ensuring that they must agree with the code they describe, or else the tests fail. By being in-line with the code they test, this increases the likelihood that both the code and the doc-comment will be *updated together*, especially if you follow some of the practices of Test-Driven Development.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Other doc-comment systems have a feature similar to Java's *decoractors* which will automatically build \"boilerplate\" code such as Object-Oriented \"getters\" and \"setters\". All you have to do is decorate the object members that should be accessed in that way. This is in addition to pointing out to any human reader that such a member is meant to be accessed only through it's get/set methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comments are written in human language which can be prone to\n",
    "  misinterpretation\n",
    "  \n",
    "    This is still true of doc-comments.  Having a structure to the comment may reduce this risk, but not eliminate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Comments embedded in code *can actually be harmful* when doing\n",
    "  polyglot meta-programming\n",
    "\n",
    "    Doc-comments are not syntactictly able to be embedded within the code like a regular comment can be (to mark out a suspicious section while debugging). They are usually strings, and have a special location within the code that must be adhered to (usually the beginning of a function or module), otherwise it's not a doc-comment.\n",
    "  \n",

    "In Java, the doc-comments' main purpose is to be the source-code for API documentation.  The goal is to be able to generate an API reference from the same code that implements the API.  It's mostly successful.  This is not strictly *Litterate Programming* because it doesn't weave instructive narative with the code, but it does at least formalise the system of commenting that I was taught in high-school:\n",

The focus of Litterate Programming is on the *humans reading the document*, and you \"weave\" the document to generate the code from it; whereas in javadoc the focus is on the *computer as the audience of the code*, and you use the `javadoc` tool to generate the document (so it's like \"tangling\").\n",
