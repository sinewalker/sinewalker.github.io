.. type: text

You may be aware:  [roses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose) don't have [thorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles#Thorns), they have [prickles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorns,_spines,_and_prickles#Prickles).  This is a fact that the band [Poison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_(American_band)) were either unaware of, or (wisely) chose to overlook in their song [Every Rose Has Its Thorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Rose_Has_Its_Thorn).

Imagine if they hadn't overlooked it:

>  Every rose has its prickle
>
>  Just like every night, we gotta trickle
>
>  Just like every cowboy has a soft place to tickle
>
>  Every rose has its prickle.
