I spent some spare hours on the week-end playing with [Pass](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeapo.pwdstore) and syncing my password-store between a Macintosh and an Android, using an online Git repository.

It's a bit tricky to get it set up,  with a few moving parts, so I'm still experimenting. Here's what I've figured out so far.

<!-- TEASER_END -->


# Migrating from KeePassX to Pass

There are scripts to migrate from other password storage systems to pass. The one I used for migrating from KeePassX is [keepass2csv2pass.py](https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store/tree/contrib/importers/keepass2csv2pass.py) which suited my needs. But I needed to do some preparations first.

## Preparing my keepass database

My database was actually pretty good for my needs, and had a nicely organised structure to it with nested password groups, pretty icons and so on.  It was great for use within a KeePassX GUI both on macOS and Linux, as well as the Android app.

After a few test imports and playing around in *pass* though, I quickly found that my password store's arrangement *sucks* for the command line!  Even with pass' supplied bash-completion (which is awesome!), having to retrieve your password like this:

```sh
$ pass -c network/google/sinewalker/sinewalker
```

is pretty *yuck*.  So the thing to do was to reorganise (in KeePassX) all my passwords to have *as flat a layout as possible*.  If a group is redundant, remove it.  I got rid of the "network" group all together and have most of my passwords just sitting in the root of the database.

When importing the CSV from KeePassX to pass, I use the ` --to_lower` and `--name_is_original` options of the `keepass2csv2pass.py` script.  The above password can now be retrieved with:

```
$ pass -c google/sinewalker
```

And that's just because I have more than one Google account.  Most passwords are even flatter. This is how to get my VPN pass-phrase:

```
$ pass -c celo-vpn
```

(it's enough to just type C E <TAB> to complete the "celo-vpn" name too!)

## Importing the KeePassX database

Importing my KeePassX database was done like this:

First, from KeePassX for macOS, I exported my database to a CSV file, which is in *clear-text*.  The MacBook is encrypted, but I still stored this clear-text copy of my passwords into my [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/) private [filesystem](https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs), to keep it secret. Just in case.

Then, I created a new password-store, initilised git and set a remote, and imported it using the keepass2csv2pass.py Python script:

```
[mjl@milo:/keybase/private/sinewalker/pass-experiment]
[21:37]$ pass init sinewalker@keybase.io MikePop4 mlockhart@squiz.net
Password store initialized for sinewalker@keybase.io, MikePop4, mlockhart@squiz.net
[mjl@milo:/keybase/private/sinewalker/pass-experiment]
[21:37]$ pass git init

[mjl@milo:/keybase/private/sinewalker/pass-experiment]
[21:38]$ keepass2csv2pass.py --to_lower --name_is_original keepass.csv
```

Some points to note from above

 * I initialised the password store using multiple GPG keys. This is probably not the best way to do it, for several reasons, and I've switched to a single GPG keypair which I share on all devices. I'll explain more about that in a bit.

 * I set the remote to a private *BitBucket* repository here.  I later learned that **BitBucket doesn't actually let you** ***write*** **to a private repo using the Git+SSH protocol** (!) So I've switched to a private *GitLab* repo instead.  I thought that using a normal *public* *GitHub* repo would just be inviting people to brute-force my password store. Yes, the GPG encryption is *Pretty Good*, but I'm not so confident about my *passphrase*!

From this point, I was ready to play around with pass itself, and to try sync between my Mac and my Android.

There are a lot of parts to this set up, enough to warrant an architecture diagram.



# The GPG keychain

Since *pass* uses GPG to secure the password store, you need to have all the keys you're going to encrypt for imported on your key chain, ***and trusted by GnuPG***.

That last part tripped me up for most of my Saturday morning, and the GnuPG errors are difficult to decipher on a good day, let alone if you're trying to understand them at the kitchen table while your kids are yelling at each other or asking you to feed them breakfast!


```
gpg: FF25A8A4E3C4B151: There is no assurance this key belongs to the named user
gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: Unusable public key
```

This means Ownership Trust needs to be established on the key.

```
gpg --edit-key FF25A8A4E3C4B151
...
gpg> trust
```


## What keys to use?


I began by using three keys to encrypt my password store

 * My [Keybase.io PGP key](https://keybase.io/sinewalker#show-public) (which is my personal master key)
 * My work PGP key
 * A key I generated for my phone, using [OpenKeyChain for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain)

This way, I thought, I can decrypt the passwords using any of these private keys, which of course I'm careful to only place appropriately.  e.g. the work secret key is only on my work computer, and the phone's secret key is only in my phone. 

Well that's true. But if I only have the *public* GPG keys for each device on the others, then that means any key created on my Android *can't be decrypted on my other devices*. I need the secret key on the key chain of each device that I'm sharing my password store on.

That would not be recommended:  the point of secret keys is that *they are secret*.  I don't want to install all my secret keys everywhere.

Pass doesn't appear to be able to use a symmetric key, so instead I have created a public/secret key pair, called "password-store", to use *just for my password-store*.  I re-initialised the password-store to use this single key pair:

```
$ pass init password-store
```

and I keep the pub/sec key pair in my keybase private filesystem.  

The Keybase.io app doesn't yet let you access the KBFS, but getting the new pub/sec pair onto the phone was simple enough: since I had already made a key for the phone, I encrypted my ASCII-armoured password-store key pair with the phone's public key and emailed it to myself. Only my phone could decrypt it.  On the phone I saved the attachment, then decrypted it and imported the pub/sec pair.  Finally I switched to using that going forward.

# Setting up Password Store on an Android


On the Android, follow these steps:

 1. (optional) Install [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/) since the *Google Play Store* version of Password Store has been crippled upon Google's request (auto-fill disabled)
 2. Install Password Store [from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zeapo.pwdstore) or F-droid
 3. Install OpenKeychain [from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.sufficientlysecure.keychain) or F-droid. This does the actual GPG and manages keys
 4. In OpenKeychain, generate a new key, e.g. 'MikePop4'
 5. Send the key to yourself by email (it sends the *public key* only)
 6. On the PC/Mac, save the email attachment
 7. Import the key to the PC/Mac keychain and Trust it's Ownership
 8. Export the Password Store pub/sec pair (or retrieve from Keybase)
 9. Encrypt the exported Password Store key pair for 'MikePop4'
 10. Email to self
 11. On the phone, save the email attachment
 12. In OpenKeychain, Decrypt the attachment
 13. In OpenKeychain, Import the pub/sec Password Store key pair
 
 Phew! At this point, you have the software and the key pair on your phone. Now you need to get the actual password store

 1. Be sure you have run `pass init password-store` (or whatever you called the GPG key pair for your password store)
 2. Make sure you've imported keys, set your remote and that you have run `pass git push all` at least once.  To push your encrypted Password Store to your online remote
 3. On the phone, open Password Store and
