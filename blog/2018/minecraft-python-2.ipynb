    "# System Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Computer**: A PC-compatible, or an Apple Macintosh\n",
    " * **Operating system**: I have tested this on [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), and with [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/windows/) and [openSUSE](https://opensuse.org) [Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed) for the PC\n",
    " * **A text editor**: I recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but any will do, such as [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html), which comes with Python\n",
    " * **Java runtime**: use the one that comes with your macOS or Linux operating system; or get [Oracle Java](https://java.com/en/) for Windows\n",
    " * **Python**: you can use a [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system\n",
    "\n",
    "(You may be wondering why I'm recommending VS Code over Spacemacs &mdash; Code is a whole heck easier to install and set up on Windows, and it's not half bad as a go-to editor anyway, especially for kids.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed instructions for setting all of this up in Windows or Mac are pretty well covered by either the [Raspberry Jam instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Python-coding-for-Minecraft/), or the [PythonTool instructions](https://ngcm.github.io/PythonTool-Mod/installation/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how I've installed on the base requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "## SUSE Linux\n",
    "\n",
    " * **MS VS Code**: [Microsoft's instructions for setting up in Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux) include support for SUSE.  I prefer to use `zypper` to add and modify the repo rather than hack the `.repo` configuration file directly:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```\n",
    " sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc\n",
    " sudo zypper ar -f https://packages.microsoft.com/yumrepos/vscode code\n",
    " sudo zypper install code\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Java**:  if not already installed, then this will do:\n",
    " ```\n",
    " sudo zypper install java-1_8_0-openjdk\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " (You can install a complete development pattern with `devel_java` that has a more up-to-date Java and some development tools, but it's not needed for Minecraft coding in Python)\n",
    " \n",
    " * **Python 3**: I have [instructions for setting up Python 3 development for my blog](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/wiki/Setup#opensuse-leap). This should be enough for Minecraft:\n",
    " \n",
    " ```\n",

    "    pattern:devel_python3 \\\n",
    "    python3-virtualenv \\\n",

    " \n",
    "You could of course combine all of those install steps into one long one&hellip;.\n",
    " \n",
    "## macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "You can visit web sites and use installer images. For instance [Microsoft's Code instructions for Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac). I prefer to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the requirements though:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Homebrew**: (if not already installed):\n",
    "```\n",
    "/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    " * **MS VS Code**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "brew cask install visual-studio-code\n",
    "```\n",
    " * **Java**: (this is included with macOS)\n",
    " * **Python 3**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "brew install python3\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Windows 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and install the pre-requisites with Windows installers:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **MS VS Code**: follow [Microsoft's instructions for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)\n",
    " * **Java**: download the installer from [Oracle's Java.com website](https://java.com) and run it to install. **Be watchful that the installer doesn't also offer to change your Web Browser to have a different Home Page or add any Search Bar extensions**...\n",
    " * **Python 3**:  visit the [Python website](https://www.python.org/). In the **Downloads** menu the web site should figure out which is the correct installer for your Windows computer.  Download that and install it\n",
