I've moved this blog to [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io). You can [continue to read new posts there](https://milosophical.me/blog), as well access all the old posts from previous hosts.

The main reason that I have done this is because I'm now employed at GitLab, so it makes sense to run my web site out of that service.

This GitHub Pages repository will remain online, served under the GH Pages domain [`https://sinewalker.github.io`](https://sinewalker.github.io)

Follow me [at the same places](https://about.me/mikelockhart)!
