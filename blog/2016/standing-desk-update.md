It's been about a year since I started standing at work, time for an update,
mainly so I can show off the desktop I built a few months ago, which is working
out quite nicely.

Making a real desktop
====

You may recall from my
[earlier post about standing desks](/blog/2015/standing-desks.html) that I was
using a convenient cardboard box, with a table-top on it, and my
[TEK209](https://www.trulyergonomic.com) keyboard. I had played with sticking a
book under the table-top to make a
[negative tilt](http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/AHTutorials/typingposture.html),
which is the only thing that the MS-4000 really has over the TEK. After a while,
the box started to sag in the middle, and of course the book fell through with a
loud bang. More than once. To much bemusement by my work colleagues.

So, having proven to myself that I can stand up for long times, and that I
wasn't likely to return to sitting any time soon, it was time to build a proper
standing desktop to replace the wobbly box.


Design

Here's a picture I took of a work colleague's fancy sit/stand desk:

What I really like about this desk is it's spacious design, and the curve at the
front. It's quite inviting, and I like how the phone and the Mac sit apart from
the keyboard and mouse. I was keen to build something like this, though not
quite so large and bulky.

The new desk
----

I spent a week-end or so with a protractor, paint tins, jigsaw, some pine
timber, dowel and glue. This is what I came up with:

It's not as deep as the professional model, but there's still plenty of room for
a desk phone and the huge Kensington Expert Mouse trackball. The routered edges
give a nice feel to the piece. It's been sanded and then polished with a
bees-wax based floor wax to finish it off.

I didn't bother to build something that can be lowered, as the screens would be
perched up high anyway. Because the desktop is static, I can place a shelf under
the desktop, which is quite handy.

It also has built-in 15Â° negative tilt:

Note though that if I put the MS-4000 keyboard on it, not only is this negative
tilt redundant (meaning I should remove the keyboard's front stand), things are
pretty tight with that surfboard. There's a picture of the MS-4000 in
[the gallery](/pixels/stand-desk/).

But I don't think I'll be using the 4000 much any more, I love my TEK too much.
I'll write my own review about it soonish: there are a few keyboard geeks who
ask me about it.

I'm still standing

*"Yeah, yeah, yeah &hellip;"*

I think the only thing I need to invest in now, is a pair or two of really good
shoes. I'm having no trouble standing all day, my posture is improving (still
not great, but I'm working on it), and my energy levels are still a lot higher
in the afternoon than they were when I was sitting. I have no complaints, and I
know a couple people around the office have desk envy.
