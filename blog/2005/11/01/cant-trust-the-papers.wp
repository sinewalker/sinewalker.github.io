<p>Why does "mainstream media" think blogging is such a huge hit? It's not that
Internet is immediate, or that anyone can do it (which has big down-sides as
well as it's egalitarian advantages). It is simply that people everywhere are
fed-up with WWII-era propagandists telling us what to believe and have started
researching it for themselves.</p>

This is the Information Revolution: the Revolution is greatly improved access
to the information. People are more educated now than they were 50 or even 20
years ago and can make informed judgements. They don't need some "journalist"
to do it for them. This is quite appart form the fact that today's journalism
is extremely poor compared to yester-year's.

I don't buy papers because I know that I can't trust them to bring me news in
an unbiased, non-politically or commercially influenced fashion, or full of
Tabloid rubbish like British newspapers. I accept the risk that the news I
learn via the Net can be from the "uninformed" masses and mitigate this by
using many sources so I can judge for myself where the "truth" lies.

<p>
I won't even read over people's shoulders anymore.

For at least the last 10 years, newspapers have been good for only one thing:
the ink used in newspaper presses is fantastic for removing streaks and smudges
from my computer monitor!</p>
