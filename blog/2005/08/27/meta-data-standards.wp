<p>I would like to see more web sites adopt meta-data labelling standards and
their presence be a factor in the ranking of the page. If more sensible pages
had been indexed, Library-Of-Congress style (or whichever standard is adopted)
then we would get many more relevant hits.

<p>
We would also get many people hacking the index by putting popular but
irelevant meta-data into their pages… I haven't figured this one out
yet. Perhaps if the meta-data is combined with some sort of AI that can read
the page and judge if the tags are for-real, or just to seed the search engine…
no this is far-out-future innovation stuff.</p>
