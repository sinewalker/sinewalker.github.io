<p>Seems that RIAA are intent on sueing more 12-year old girls for sharing music... it sickens me.

I am not sure what to do to protest (beyond what seems to be happening already
— consumers aren't buying today's crap, and RIAA/ARIA/MPAA etc are just blaming
it on the Net anyway). I am considering what would happen if lots of fans
started writing directly to their favourite artists and asking them these
questions:

</p>

<br/>

<ul>
  <li>why do you have this deal with your distributor EMI? I can't play your
  <li>why don't you consider putting sample tracks on your web site? For that matter, why don't you deal directly with Apple, or start your own pay-per-download site for your songs? I'm sure heaps of fans like me will buy them, and you could get a much larger cut per track than Warner Bros is giving you</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>
Of course, there are costs to running a web site also. But I wonder if what may
happen eventually is a return to music guilds, where a guild runs the site,
member groups contribute content and all proffit goes to the members. It would
probably be a good business to start, atracting new groups like the “Idol” TV
shows do now. Shame I have hopeless business sense though.
