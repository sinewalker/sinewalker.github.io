<p>I've added the new “tag roll” and “link roll” to the right in
      this blog's template.  Looks great, but examining my tags reveals I'm a
      bit disorganised, huh?</p>

<br/>

<p>
That's nothing, you should check out my tags in Flickr.  Definitely could do with some improvement there.

<a href="http://del.icio.us/help/tags">Tags</a> are a great idea.  The trouble is, I'm uncertain how best to use them.
That is, what are the best tag words to attach to a link or photo so that I can
find the right one again? How can I best group my del.icio.us tags
into <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/bundles">Bundles </a>to facilitate
research? Should I even try?</p>

I guess only experience will help. So I'll keep persevering :-).  Also, since tags are social, looking at how other people have tagged their stuff could be instructive too.</p></body></html>
