<p>New del.icio.us rolls do not appear at right-hand side of this site, even though they did in Preview?  Strange.  Maybe it's a blogger glitch?  See what happens in a few days, I suppose...

<strong>UPDATE</strong>:  2006-03-20 12:45 -- Not a glitch. Strange behaviour when I commented the del.icio.us block in the template.  It seems that the comment block wasn't terminated?  Odd.  Fixed by removing my comments.  This is sub-optimal, but works at least.</p>
