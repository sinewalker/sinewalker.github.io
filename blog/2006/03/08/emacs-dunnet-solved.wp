So I'll have to play again, and make a map too... 'cause it's the geek thing to do.
</p>

<h4>UPDATE: 20081126 - Finding the egg</h4>
<p>
As noted in the cheats above, the egg is in a random spot between rooms 60-78 (inclusive). Here are two stategies (besides peeking at the <code>dunnet.el</code> code) for finding the egg:
</p>

<br/>

<ol>
	<li>In the <em>pokey </em>Unix environment (in-game) do directory listings of all the rooms between Main and Fourth St, intersecting between Maple and Sycamore Ave. If the room contains the egg, it'll be listed as egg.o in the Unix environment. Note where it is, then go and fetch it.</li>
	<li>Head along Main St looking for the egg, then up and down First, Second, Third... &amp;c. until you find it.</li>
</ol>

<br/>

<p>
Another idea to try (theoretical, but interesting, from TimHorse' comment below):
</p>

<br/>

<ul>
	<li>Login to <em>pokey </em>as the wizard, then type <code><strong>echo $dun-room-objects</strong></code> to find out where ALL of the objects are, find the egg (item 18, see <code><strong>$dun-objects</strong></code>) then have a look at <strong><code>$dun-rooms</code></strong>...</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>
More ideas to try as the wizard in <em>pokey </em>(from some tips at the <a title="Ron Schnell" href="http://www.driver-aces.com/ronnie.html">Dunnet author</a>'s <a title="Ronnie's Dunnet hints" href="http://www.driver-aces.com/dunnet.html">hints page</a>):
</p>

<br/>

<ul>
	<li><strong><code>dun-current-room=tloc</code></strong> to go directly to the room containing the egg</li>
	<li><code><strong>dun-items='(append 18 dun-items)</strong></code>, to add the egg to your inventory directly (a truely <a title="Moby definition (jargon file)" href="/jargon/html/M/moby.html">moby</a> <a title="definition (jargon file)" href="/jargon/html/H/hack.html">hack</a>)</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>
I'm actually motivated to play this game on the train tonight...
</p>

<br/>

<p>
I still haven't made a map, maybe one day. It should be fairly simple to use the code as a starting point, but the up/down could be tricky to map.</p></body></html>
