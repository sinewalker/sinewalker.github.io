<p>The <a href="http://www.ietf.org">IETF </a>(Internet Engineering Task Force)
  is the international community of network experts who have been designing the
  main Internet “standards” for the past 30 years or so.  These include such
  landmark standards
  as <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt?number=822">RFC822</a>
  (email) and RFCs2045-2047 (MIME).  New standards continue to be published and
  implemented today.</p>

Two IETF contributions may be especially helpful for our current issues at work in transferring data between two isolated systems.  For the published IETF documents, see:
