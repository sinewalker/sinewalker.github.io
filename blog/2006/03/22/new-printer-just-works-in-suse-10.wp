<p>Well, here's a first for me:  go to local Dick Smith's, buy a
      cheap printer, for my wife  (HP Deskjet 3940, AU$66).  Because I don't
      really care about printing from Linux, I didn't care if it works or not
      on that OS, just bought whatever Windows printer was cheapest.</p>

<br/>


<p>
Brought it home, plugged it into my PC (in Windows) and it works, after installing drivers and software and about 15 mins of setup time.</p>

<br/>


<p>
For the heck of it, I rebooted to Linux to see what would happen.  Well lordy
“New hardware detected:  HPdeskjet3940” and an offer to set it up. After 5
minutes — just accepting all the standard options — out comes a test page, in
colour, bi-directional and fast.</p>

<br/>

<p>
Neat.  Linux is ready for me....</p></body></html>
