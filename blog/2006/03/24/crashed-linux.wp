This is a pretty neat shot of the in-flight entertainment system on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330">Airbus A330</a> having a boot-up issue. Note, the kernel is Linux.

This photo has a big rant in the flickr comments about whether or not it's a Linux crash. Well, what's a Linux crash? Most of the public Windows crashes do not involve the Windows kernel (except for blue-screens) but they get called Windows crashes. So, to be fair, this is a Linux crash, even if it appears that the kernel itself is fine.</p></body></html>
