<p>Was thinking about the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">Free as in Freedom</a>, vs Free as in Beer analogy and I found a problem with the Free as in Beer offering.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
Beer is actually already nearly Free as in Freedom, since the process to produce your own beer, and many good recipes are public domain. So maybe the analogy should be “free as in Coke™”. This works better, because someone can give away Coke bottles full of CocaCola™, and this is not the same as being given the secret recipe to make your own Coke.

<p>
Just a thought, anyway.</p></body></html>
