I think I may have figured out the issue with my CD recorder.  It seems to fail
more when the weather is hot (as in, more than 32Â° C ambient).  The internal
case temperature would be in the low to mid 40s then, and this is probably
close to the maximum operating temperature for the device (a SONY CD-RW
CRX140E).</p>

Bummer.

So, either I confine my CD writing to early in the morings on hot nights, or I
evaluate some sort of cooling solution.</p>
