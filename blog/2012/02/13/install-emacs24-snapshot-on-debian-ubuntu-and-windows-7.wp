(I know, it's in beta and it'll be officially released Real Soon Now, but my catalyst is Technomancy's ESK2 which is such an improvement over ESK1, and it needs Emacs 24).


In <a title="Build/Install emacs 24 on debian" href="http://sinewalker.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/build-and-install-emacs24-on-debian-squeeze/">my last post</a> I had steps to build emacs from source-code. This is worth following for hacker cred, but it soon gets tedious if you have a lot of systems to put emacs on. As pointed out by a few readers, there are some snapshot builds available for different platforms. This post lists steps for installing the pre-built snapshots, for the three operating systems that I use.



<!-- TEASER_END -->



</p><h3>Debian</h3>

As pointed out earlier, you can get <a href="http://emacs.naquadah.org/">emacs-snapshot builds for Debian</a> from Julien Danjou (of <a href="http://awesome.naquadah.org">awesome</a> fame). That page does have instructions, but I'll list them here anyway:



<ol>
 <li>Import the key (this is a one-line pipeline, broken for display only):
<pre>

$ <strong>wget -q -O - http://emacs.naquadah.org/key.gpg 

| sudo apt-key add -</strong>



</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Add the snapshot repository to your <strong><code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code></strong> (by hand). Here's Julien's "stable" snapshot:
<pre>

deb http://emacs.naquadah.org/ stable/

deb-src http://emacs.naquadah.org/ stable/



</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Update your package database
<pre>

$ <strong>sudo aptitude update</strong>



</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Install emacs-snapshot
<pre>

$ <strong>sudo aptitude install <code>emacs-snapshot</code></strong>



</pre>
 </li>
</ol>



<h3>Ubuntu</h3>

I'm running Ubuntu 11.10 in a VirtualBox on work's Windows 7 machine. As mentioned at Julien Danjou's page,

Damien Cassou makes a version of the same emacs-snapshot for Ubuntu, which is hosted <a title="emacs-snapshot PPA for ubuntu" href="https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs">at Launchpad</a>. You add it and install simalarly:



<ol>
 <li>Add the PPA (Personal Package Archive). This also imports the key:
<pre>

$ <strong>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cassou/emacs</strong>



</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Update your package database
<pre>

$ <strong>sudo apt-get update</strong>



</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Install emacs-snapshot
<pre>

$ <strong>sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot</strong>



</pre>
 </li>
</ol>



<h3>Windows</h3>

It's handy to have a native Windows emacs as well as the one in the VM. Of course being Windows, it's more complicated to install and configure... This has been tested on Windows 7:



<ol>
 <li>Download the latest PKZIP-ed binary from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/emacs-for-windows/updates/list">Google Code</a></li>
 <li>Unpack the ZIP (Windows Explorer <em>can</em> open ZIP files -- but <a href="http://www.7-zip.org">7zip</a> is mich nicer). I like to unpack emacs in <code><strong>c:\Applications\emacs</strong></code><em>&lt;version&gt;</em> so I can maintain several different versions at once</li>
 <li>(<em>optional</em>) Put a windows symlink to the version of emacs you want to use.  This assumes your C: drive is formatted with NTFS, which on most Windows systems it is. The symlink can then be used for your %PATH% later and you won't have to edit the variable again to change versions, which for some odd reason is a convoluted operation in Windows... Type the following in a <strong>CMD.EXE</strong> prompt:
<pre>

C:\&gt; <strong>CD C:\Applications</strong>

C:\Applications\&gt; <strong>MKLINK /D emacs emacs</strong><em>&lt;version&gt;</em>



</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Create an <em>Environment Variable</em> called <code><strong>%HOME%</strong></code> that refers to your Windows home directory (<code>C:\Users\</code><em>&lt;username&gt;</em>). This is so that you can put your <code>.emacs.d</code> in your home directory, and Emacs will find it:
 <ol type="a">
  <li>Open <strong>Windows Explorer</strong></li>
  <li>Right-click on "<strong>My Computer</strong>", choose "<strong>Properties</strong>"</li>
  <li>Choose "<strong>Advance system settings</strong>" (Really? what's so advanced about an environment variable?)</li>
  <li>Make sure the "<strong>Advanced</strong>" tab of the <strong>System Properties</strong> dialog is selected, then press the "<strong>Environment Variables...</strong>" button</li>
  <li>Press the top "<strong>New...</strong>" button (to add a personal variable, rather than system variable)</li>
  <li>in the "<strong>Variable name:</strong>" field, enter <code><strong>HOME</strong></code>. In the "<strong>Variable value:</strong>" field, put <code><strong>%USERPROFILE%</strong></code>, press "<strong>OK</strong>" button</li>
  <li>Press the other "<strong>OK</strong>" button to dismiss the Environment Varables dialog</li>
  <li>Press yet another "<strong>OK</strong>" button to dismiss the System Properties dialog</li>
 </ol>
 </li>
 <li>Put emacs in your <code><strong>%PATH%</strong></code>. Use the same steps above to edit the Sytem variable PATH and add the path to Emacs (<code><strong>;C:\Applications\emacs\bin</strong></code> if you put a symlink in step 3)</li>
</ol>



<h3>Personal Emacs settings</h3>

You can now put your emacs settings into <code>~/.emacs.d</code> (that's <code>%HOME%\.emacs.d</code> for Windows). I highly recommend <a title="Technomany's home" href="http://technomancy.us/">Technomancy</a>'s <a title="GitHub ESK2 branch" href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a> (version 2).



My own<code> ~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> is set up to bootstrap ESK2 and a few favourite packages, just as Technomancy describes. 



One package I'd like to mention here is "<a href="http://xahlee.org/emacs/ergonomic_emacs_keybinding.html">ergoemacs-keybindings</a>" which gives more modern/ergonomic key bindings to emacs. Together with cua-mode, it makes Emacs behave very nicely. Currently though I notice there's a problem loading the package (maybe it's autoloads aren't right yet?) So I have to hack it as described in the package's README, (with a hard-coded path to the package directory, that'll break if I update it in the future because it has the package version) but I hope to fix it and send a patch for Xah Real Soon Now...  In the mean-time, here's a snippet:




~~~~~~~~~~~~{.clojure}


;;;; egroemacs keybindings

(setenv "ERGOEMACS_KEYBOARD_LAYOUT" "dv") ; US Dvorak (Ergonomic)



;; FIX: for some reason the library isn't loading from the package? 

;;      Have to put full path to the load file, which is brittle

(when (package-installed-p 'ergoemacs-keybindings)
  (load-file "~/.emacs.d/elpa/ergoemacs-keybindings-5.3.9/ergoemacs-keybindings.el")
  (ergoemacs-mode 1)
  (cua-mode 1))

~~~~~~~~~~~~




(btw, the lisp-ish CSH above is done by using WordPress' sourcecode block and specifying "clojure" for the language)</body></html>
