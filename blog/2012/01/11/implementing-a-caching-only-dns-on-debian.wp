<html><body><p>After 3 years of sticking with Novell, I recently switched away from openSUSE to <a title="Debian GNU/Linux" href="http://www.debian.org" target="_blank">Debian</a>. There are a few reasons why, but I won't bore you with them. So far I'm liking it. There are a few things to set up before I settle in, and one is slow DNS lookup.</p>

I described how and why to make a <a title="Implementing a caching-only DNS on openSUSE" href="http://sinewalker.wordpress.com/2010/07/20/implementing-a-caching-only-dns-on-opensuse/">caching-only DNS on openSUSE</a> in July 2010.  In Debian it's a little different:

</p><ol>
	<li>Install bind of course. The package is called <em>bind9 </em>and installs itself as a service and starts automatically, no need to mess with runlevels:
         <div>
          <pre># <strong>aptitude install bind9</strong></pre>
         </div>
        </li>
	<li>The config for bind in Debian is a subdirectory structure in <code>/etc/bind</code>.  For a simple caching-only server, you leave /etc/bind/named.conf untouched and instead change <code><strong>/etc/bind/named.conf.options</strong></code> to have your <em>forwarders</em>:
        <div>
<pre><code>// MJL20120111 - Adding Google2, OpenDNS1, gateway

forwarders {
    8.8.4.4; 208.67.222.222; 192.168.1.1;
};</code></pre>
         </div>
        </li>
	<li>Restart bind to load the new configuration:
         <div>
          <pre># <strong>service bind9 restart</strong></pre>
         </div>
        </li>
	<li>You will need to change your network to use the local bind. I used <a title="NetworkManager's home page" href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a> on the GNOME desktop, but you can just edit <strong><code>/etc/resolv.conf</code></strong>:
    <div>
<pre><code>nameserver 127.0.0.1 #local bind</pre></code>
    </div>
If you edit the file by hand, you'll have to restart the network somehow (haven't found out how yet, except with NetworkManager).</li>
	<li>Done. Test it:
         <div>
<pre>$ <strong>nslookup australia.gov.au</strong>
Server:127.0.0.1
Address:127.0.0.1#53Non-authoritative answer:
Name:australia.gov.au
Address: 205.239.168.12</pre>
         </div>
        </li>
</ol>

<p>All good, and much faster. Happy surfing.</p></body></html>
