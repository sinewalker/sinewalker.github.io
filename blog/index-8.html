                <p>Well, after 5 years and the setting of the Sun, Java SE 1.7 (originally code-named "dolphin") has finally been released. Joyous celebrations from the land of Duke.</p>


<!--more-->


<p>
There's much that has been long looked for in this release, and I'm happy about it — especially the nio.2 filesystem API and the improved support on the platform for scripting languages and dynamic languages. But the "improvements" to the Java language itself only highlight to me that this language is pretty well into zombie status (it's dead and yet it keeps trying to live and eat more developers' brains).
</p>

<p>
Take this enhancement to the language that finally allows you to do a switch on Strings. This bit of syntactic sugar has been on my own wish list since 1997 (when I first started to play with Java and discovered you couldn't switch on Strings). But of course, the bureaucrats have bodged it. Look at this code:
</p>


<pre>
public class StringSwitch {
    public static String getFruitColour(String name) {
        switch (name) {
        case "apple":
        case "raspberry":
        case "strawberry":
            return "Red";
        case "banana":
        case "lemmon":
            return "Yellow";
        case "kiwi":
        case "grapes":
        case "lime":
            return "Green";
        case "orange":
        case "pawpaw":
            return "Orange";
        default:
            return "Unknown";
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(getFruitColour("guava"));  // should fall through to default
        System.out.println(getFruitColour(null));     // actually causes NPE at the switch
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
This should work, and the null string should cause the switch to fall through. Seems reasonable, yes? Well, no. You get an NPE:

</p>
<blockquote>

<pre>$ <strong>java StringSwitch</strong>

Unknown

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at StringSwitch.getFruitColour(StringSwitch.java:4)
	at StringSwitch.main(StringSwitch.java:26)</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Damn it, guys! How does this make my coding simpler? Now I have to remember that if I'm switching on String, I have to guard against NPEs. Okay, it's better than nested <code>if</code>'s, but it's a serious gotcha. Again. Here's one solution, though of course, being Java, it's fugly:


</p>
<pre>
public class StringSwitch {
    public static String getFruitColour(String name) {
        if (name != null) {
            switch (name) {
                case "apple":
                case "raspberry":
                case "strawberry":
                    return "Red";
                case "banana":
                case "lemmon":
                    return "Yellow";
                case "kiwi":
                case "grapes":
                case "lime":
                    return "Green";
                case "orange":
                case "pawpaw":
                    return "Orange";
                default:
                    return "Unknown";
            }
        } else {
            return "Unknown (NULL)"; // bleah.
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(getFruitColour("guava"));  // should fall through to default
        System.out.println(getFruitColour(null));     // this time the NPE is guarded
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
If anything, Java 7 demonstrates that the JVM is a great platform for dynamic languages other than Java. Like for instance Scala and Clojure... How disappointing.

                <p>There is a bug in the integration between Emacs' EasyPG and the "new" GnuPG2 that causes Emacs to not load <code>.gpg</code> files when running in a text terminal.  It's being worked on, apparently, but in the mean-time, here is how to fix it.


<!--more-->



The only solution I've found that works is to install a copy of GnuPG1 concurrent with the new GnuPG2.  They can live happily side-by-side.  Once you've done that, you need to tell EasyPG to use the old program rather than the new one. Full details are on the <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EasyPG">Emacs Wiki</a>, here it is in a nutshell:

</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can find an RPM package of GnuPG1 for openSUSE on the <a title="gpg1" href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/binary?arch=i586&amp;filename=gpg1-1.4.9-2.1.i586.rpm&amp;package=gpg1&amp;project=security%3Aprivacy&amp;repository=openSUSE_11.2">openSUSE Build Service</a>
</li>
	<li>Once installed, you need to customize the variable <code><strong>epg-gpg-program</strong></code>.  Either use <code>M-x customize</code> to set it for all future sessions, or see my code snippet below that I put in my start-up scripts.  It should be set to the value <em>"/usr/bin/gpg1"</em> (or wherever <code>gpg1</code> is installed on your platform)</li>
	<li>Now when EasyPG opens a <code>.gpg</code> file, it will prompt for the passphrase in the Emacs minibuffer, instead of trying to use the <code>gpg-agent</code> and calling the <code>pinentry</code> program (which causes Emacs to hang in text mode)</li>
</ul>

 



If you like to use the gpg agent and graphical pinentry programs and only want to override GnuPG2 with GnuPG1 when running Emacs in a text terminial, then you can put code like this in your Emacs start-up (mine goes in <code>~/.emacs.d/&lt;username&gt;.el</code> because I use the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a>):

  (setq epg-gpg-program "/usr/bin/gpg1")) ; use GnuPG1 in text terminals</pre> </code>

done it a long time ago.'

When I was young, my family bought a color TV. Our neigbors, who were

poorer, had only a black-and-white set. They bought a piece of cellophane,

                <p>Lately I've been noticing significant DNS latency when visiting certain sites. This is most obvious when my browser spends ages with "Looking up some.web.server.com..." in it's status bar. It's particularly bad at sites like <em>wordpress.com</em> where many pages make reference to sub-domains of wordpress.com and typically also to <em>google.com</em> for analytics or ads.


While my ISP's DNS infrastructure is pretty good, there are a couple of things I can do to improve DNS look-up, which makes page loads a lot quicker.

<!--more-->

There are two things which can significantly speed up DNS look-ups for your local clients:

</p>
<ul>
	<li>Switch to a faster name service</li>
	<li>Cache your look-ups on your machine, to prevent repeat DNS requests for sites you often visit</li>
</ul>

Of course, a combination works well too.



So, what name service do you use? I know of two free/open services that are pretty good and promising to get better:

<ul>
	<li>
<a title="OpenDNS" href="http://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a>: This is a globally distributed service that's fairly quick and is free to use. It also offers a simple (and easily bypassed) content filtering service by blocking known domain names</li>
	<li>
<a title="Google Public DNS" href="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/">Google Public DNS</a>: This is a recent service offered by Google as an experiment in DNS technologies. Again it's globally distributed (using any-cast so the same IP routes to the Google data centre closest to you). No filtering is provided</li>
</ul>

Both are great services. <a title="Unixmen: Google vs OpenDNS" href="http://www.unixmen.com/news-today/612-opendns-vs-google-dns">Performance varies depending on where in the world you are</a>.  Since I'm in Australia, Google beats OpenDNS, but I'm going to use both of these and my ISP since it's still fairly good too.

<h2>Hack 0: install and configure BIND</h2>

In openSUSE, you can install <a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIND">bind</a> like this (as root):

<pre style="padding-left:30px;"><code># <strong>zypper install bind</strong>

</code></pre>

Although the program is called <a title="Internet Systems Consortium's page about BIND" href="http://www.isc.org/software/bind">BIND</a>, <a title="Off-topic: interesting diversion in application of use-mention in various fields. It comes up quite a lot in computers :)" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+name+of+the+song%22+haddocks+eyes">the name of the service is</a> actually <a title="TLDP, NAG2, Running named" href="http://tldp.org/LDP/nag2/x-087-2-resolv.named.html">named</a> (name daemon). It's configured with the file <strong><code>/etc/named.conf</code></strong>. Edit this (as root) to add a list of up to three forwarding DNS name servers. I'm going with Google as Primary, then OpenDNS, then my router (which forwards to my ISP):

<pre style="padding-left:30px;"><code>forwarders { 8.8.4.4; 208.67.222.222; 16.1.1.1; };

</code></pre>

Next, you need to tell openSUSE to start the DNS server at boot time. It makes sense to have it running whenever there are network services. In openSUSE, this means at <a title="(Wikipedia) - what's a runlevel" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runlevel">runlevels</a> 3 and 5. I use <a title="Yet another Setup Tool - the reason I still run openSUSE" href="http://chorgan.provo.novell.com/yast/doc/SL11.1/">YaST</a> because it's so simple:

<pre style="padding-left:30px;"><code># <strong>yast2 runlevel</strong>

</code></pre>

Finally, start the server. Either do it from YaST, or with the command-line:

<pre style="padding-left:30px;"><code># <strong>service named start</strong>

</code></pre>

<h2>Hack 1: local resolver</h2>

This is simple: add the nameserver addresses to your <code><strong>/etc/resolv.conf</strong></code>, like so:

<pre style="padding-left:30px;"><code>nameserver 127.0.0.1      # Localhost bind

nameserver 8.8.4.4        # Google

nameserver 208.67.222.222 # OpenDNS

nameserver 16.1.1.1       # My router (forwards requests to my ISP)

</code>

</pre>

There are alternate addresses for each of Google and OpenDNS, I've chosen one each above. The other addresses are <strong>8.8.8.8</strong> for Google, and <strong>208.67.220.220</strong> for OpenDNS. OpenDNS also offers "family shield" on <strong>.123</strong> but your teenager (or maybe your six-year-old?)  can bypass that pretty easily.

<h2>Other computers</h2>

Now, any time your browser makes a DNS look-up, the resolv.conf tells it to try your local DNS server first, which in turn forwards to Google, OpenDNS and the router, and caches the results for next time.



If you want other machines in your house to use this name server, <a title="Configuring nameservers for different operating systems - use your own address instead of FamilyShield" href="https://store.opendns.com/familyshield/setup/computer">just configure them</a>. If you point their primary DNS server at your openSUSE box's address, they will use the same named you just configured.

                <p>Older X.org and XFree86 used to have this neat feature where pressing Ctrl+&lt;numpad +&gt; and Ctrl+&lt;numpad -&gt; would cycle through the screen modes defined in your config file in the "Screen" section, effectively switching screen modes on the fly and letting you pan around the full virtual screen size with the mouse.


This was a really useful feature for zooming in on small details, or to blow up videos without incurring high CPU overhead.



But since about X.org 1.7 this feature seems to be missing.  I've been researching and discovered why it's missing, and what to do about it.

<!--more-->

</p>
<h2>So why is it missing?</h2>

It's part of an architecture change in X.org and Linux, to support screen-mode switching for suspend/resume on laptop computers and a few other stability problems and useability things. Also it has something to do with the "kvm" module in the Linux kernel I <em>think</em>.  (KVM doesn't work with my Radeon driver, at least not the version included in openSUSE 11.2, yet openSUSE has it enabled by default in 11.2, but that's another story).

<h2>What can I do about it?</h2>

You can look into screen magnifying software to make parts of the screen larger. Ew! (The whole point of switching screen mode is that the monitor does the magnification in hardware, rather than using the CPU or the GPU, so I can watch YouTube full-screen without the CPU having to multiply the pixels)



Alternatively this functionality is replaced by the new <a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XRandR">XRandR</a> extension to X11. You can list the modes defined for your system, as well as the status of all your screens connected to your card with the command-line tool <code><strong>xrandr</strong></code>:

<pre><code>

[~]archimedes$ <strong>xrandr</strong>

Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1280 x 1024, maximum 3840 x 1200

VGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)

<em>DVI-0</em> connected 1280x1024+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 338mm x 270mm panning 1280x1024+0+0
   <em>1280x1024</em>      60.0*+   75.0     60.0*
   <em>1152x864</em>       75.0
   <em>1024x768</em>       75.0     70.1     60.0
   <em>832x624</em>        74.6
   <em>800x600</em>        72.2     75.0     60.3     56.2
   <em>640x480</em>        75.0     72.8     66.7     59.9
   <em>720x400</em>        70.1
S-video disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)



</code></pre>

So from above info I can see:

<ul>
	<li>My LCDs native resolution is 1280x1024</li>
	<li>This screen is identified as "DVI-0" to xrandr</li>
	<li>The 1280x1024 mode is set as the Preferred mode (marked with a +) which makes sense because it matches the LCD</li>
	<li>That mode is set as the Current mode (marked with a *)</li>
	<li>I have a list of the other modes available, as well as supported refresh rates</li>
</ul>

Now I can change screen mode like this:

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><code>xrandr --output DVI-0 --mode 800x600 --panning 1280x1024</code></strong></p>

That keeps the virtual screen at the same size but the actual display mode is 800x600 (without the --panning switch, the virtual screen size changes to match the mode, which isn't fun really).  I can switch back with:

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><code>xrandr --output DVI-0 --mode 1280x1024 --panning 1280x1024</code></strong></p>

Now all that remains is to bind these commands to keyboard shortcuts. The way to do that depends on the desktop environment you use. I'm still looking into how to do it for KDE and / or Awesome.



Oh, and if I ever plug my screen in via the VGA port, I'd need to change the "DVI-0" to "VGA-0" on my machine.

<h2>Rationale</h2>

After living in emacs for a few years I've come to appreciate it's <a title="What's LCARS?" href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/LCARS">LCARS</a> style of window panels, so I started to investigate arranging windows at a more global level in my X desktop. I discovered <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">tiling window managers</a> and started researching them. I decided I want a light-weight, no-fuss tiling window manager for many reasons, not least being that overlapping windows become a mess, and the computer should really be taking care of arranging windows for me.  So I investigated several, narrowing down to <a title="Written in Haskel, not too bad" href="http://xmonad.org">xmonad</a>, <a title="Window Manager Improved 2" href="http://wmii.suckless.org">wmii</a> and finally settling on <a title="This is gonna be LEGEN ... wait for it ... DARY" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/">awesome</a>.



However I still like the general KDE environment with all it's facilities like <a title="The semantic desktop" href="http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main1/">Nepomuk</a>, <a title="Plasma" href="http://plasma.kde.org/">Plasma</a>, the <a title="KDE Desktop COmmunications Protocol" href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/other/dcop.html">DCOP</a>, knotify  integration, <a title="KDE Plasma desktop Run Command" href="http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner">krunner</a>, hooks to Firefox and the trash can and so on -- all tools I can't live without. So I don't want to give  up KDE altogether just to have a better window manager. What I really want to do is run the KDE environment, but use awesome instead of kwin to manage my windows. If I can keep the eye-candy of transparent windows then that'd be a bonus.



After a week-end of research and hacking, here are my results.

<h2>Installing awesome</h2>

This is a cinch on openSUSE, and probably also on most distro's.  In openSUSE I just used the <a title="Webpin integrated into Yast" href="http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Research/YaST_Interface_for_Webpin">Webpin</a> module in YaST to find <a title="awesome packages in the OBS" href="https://build.opensuse.org/search/search">a package</a> on the <a title="OpenSUSE Build Service - for end-users, this is akin to Ubunto/Debian Universe" href="https://build.opensuse.org/">OBS</a> and then installed that directly from the Webpin module, which added the repository and downloaded and installed the packages for me.



Once installed, this gives an additional Session type on the kdm login screen, which is neat for testing or using awesome by itself, but when you launch KDE it's still the same (as you would expect!)

<h2>Replacing the KDE window manager</h2>

After some searching on a few forums I found that KDE's window manager can be set by putting the following into a script in the per-user KDE environment directory (<code>~/.kde4/env</code> for KDE4)

<p style="padding-left:30px;"><code>KDEWM=/usr/bin/awesome</code></p>

This has the advantage that it only affects you, not everyone on the system who runs KDE.  Also it's easy to turn off and get the original kwin back if you want to.  I may look into adding KDE+awesome as a session type and then having a separate section in my <code>~/.xinitrc</code> in the future if I'll be swapping back more often.  I don't anticipate it today though.

<h2>Fixing Java</h2>

There is a <a title="Java reparinting window bug" href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6429775">bug</a> in Java 1.5 and 1.6 where it makes protocol assumptions that are not true in non-reparanting window managers (something along those lines anyway).  It results in Java GUIs appearing as just a grey box in certain window managers like xgl, dwm, wmii, xmonad and awesome. <a title="awesome tip to fix grey Java windows" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Problems_with_Java">Apparently</a> this'll be fixed in Java 1.7. In the mean-time, to fix it for 1.5 and 1.6 you can install a utility called <a title="wmname" href="http://tools.suckless.org/wmname">wmname</a> (I used Webpin again) and then put this in a script to run at start-up (i.e. in <code>~/.kde4/Autostart</code>)

<pre style="padding-left:30px;"><code>#!/bin/sh

/usr/bin/wmname LG3D

</code></pre>

The "LG3D" window manager name above is one of the strings that 1.5 and 1.6 JVMs look for and change their behavior if found. This value is the name of the<a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass"> LookingGlass3D</a> window manager, by Sun. Appreciate the irony...

<h2>Composite effects (transparency and shadows)</h2>

I found <a title="explains xcompmgr and setting it up" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xcompmgr">this link</a> on the ArchLinux wiki. It's very useful and describes how to enable <a title="Enabling composite extension in Xorg 7.1+" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Composite">composite</a> effects by default in your Xorg, and includes a <a title="start/stop xcompmgr" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xcompmgr#Starting.2FStopping_xcompmgr_on_Demand">script</a> to turn effects on and off (quite useful on my aging AthlonXP  + Radeon, which can <em>only just</em> handle the effects, but works nice and snappy without them).



With all this done I have a nice stable and useful desktop which I can begin to tweak when I get a chance to play with the Lua language that Awesome is configured with. More toys to play with :)
