I've been coming to my sons class when I get a chance and showing the kids about computer codes. I actually started a [CodeClub](https://codeclubau.org) last year and we were pretty successful, though very limited by my availability -- I was able to run the club for one hour *most* weeks, so it took us two terms to cover [Scratch 1](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/scratch/).

This year I've had even less time away from work, but I've had great support from the grade 6 teacher. We plan for him to facilitate the projects in class while I assist via emails and blogs. So: here's my first post.

## CodeClub, `#getkidscoding`, and Scratch

I started last year by registering a CodeClub and working through the Scratch projects on the Scratch 1 module.  This was well received by the kids.  This year we skimmed that module (since half the class is made of the same pupils as last year) -- the kids have all kept up, even those who weren't exposed before.  I think it's for two reasons:

 1. We paired experienced kids with newbies
 2. All the kids are in grade 6, instead of a mixed 4/5 class

The coding language we used is [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That's the famous MIT.  Scratch has been a great environment because it's readily accessible on school computers without installing anything, and it's so engaging. Also the block-codes remove hurdles of syntax and typing errors that older languages I grew up with such as LOGO and BASIC had.

Unfortunately it has a problem: the runtime is based upon Adobe Flash, which is being phased out by Adobe and support on browsers is already being disabled: I can't run it on my work's computer; I don't know how long before the school computers also turn it off. There is an [HTML5 Scratch player](https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/HTML5_Player) project, with [code on GitHub](https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/HTML5_Player), but it's only 40% complete and being worked on by volunteers, not MIT staff. Nobody has time to get it going properly, which is sad.

But there is good news:  Scratch is only the beginning of the CodeClub coding journey. They have projects using HTML/CSS, and Python, which can also be run from a browser without installing anything on school equipment. They use *Trinket* for an in-browser editor *and runtime*.

## Trinket

[Trinket]( https://trinket.io) is a great resource for learning to code in schools, because:

 * It requires only an HTML5 browser. Anything newer than 2014 will do
 * Pupils *are not required to sign in or have an email address*:  You can bookmark links to resume your projects
 * The editor, while fairly basic, has syntax highlighting and balances parethesis/quote pairs, so you can get feedback when you make typing mistakes.

I believe it's time to expose the kids to some "real" code: they have a great grounding from Scratch and understand the basics of Sequence, Blocks, Loops, and Branches, so it's only a small step up.

## What will we be doing

I'm undecided.  We could move on to the [HTML&CSS projects](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/webdev/), which will be a great grounding in how the Web works, and give the pupils an opportunity for some *real* "computer *literacy*" -- they will be able not only to *use* the web as a resource, but express themselves and create new work in the medium.

On the other hand, we could tackle the [Python modules](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/).  Python is the main programming language used for the Raspberry Pi, with good reason. It's also very popular as a language for conducting scientific research, as an extension language for games (e.g. [Minecraft PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-minecraft-pi/)) and office software ([Libre Office](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyoo/1.0), or [Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/)), and to program robots.

Both can be done straight away.  I am thinking to actually ask the pupils what they would like to do.

## Why not both?

Well, we *could* do that. It's a matter of how much time is available to work through these things, and what goals we want to set for the end of the year.  Personally I don't think we could work through *all* the modules of both, but we could pick-and-choose according to end goals. The risk is trying to learn 2 coding languages at once (actually 3 if you count HTML and CSS as separate languages) could be confusing. Or not: maybe I shouldn't underestimate the kids?

I know that the class has some LEGO&trade; NXT&trade; robots that they would like to program, so that is yet another direction.

## Getting started with Trinket

Whichever language we choose to use, we'll be using Trinket to do the coding.  Getting started is really simple:

 * Open an HTML5 web browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, MS-Edge)
 * Visit [https://trinket.io](https://trinket.io)
 * If you want to, you can create an account and sign in
 * Or, you can instead visit [This bare project I created anonymously](https://trinket.io/python/33e5c3b81b) and then start to code.

### Saving work

You can keep your work *without having a Trinket.io account*:  Just click the "**Share**" menu, and choose "**Link**".  You can copy the URL and store it in your notebook. I'll be recommending pupils to follow my [fourth rule of computing](/blog/2015/4-bit-rules-of-computing-part-1.html).

## Stay tuned

I'm really excited to get going for the final term of school and also continue into future years.
