Do you receive email with a mystery "J" or "L" in them?

```
Fabulous! Thanks very much Mike J
```

What the heck are they?  It's actually not much of a mystery: they are
automatic emoticons inserted by MS-Outlook when someone types `:-)` or
variants.

Outlook substitutes the string for the letter J or L, and formats that
character with ***Windings***, which in that font maps to the smiley
or the frowny glyph.

I *guess* if you look at J and L sideways, and pretend only half their
mouth is working, it kinda makes sense for a J to be a smile and an L
to be a frown...?

Well, anyway, now you know.
