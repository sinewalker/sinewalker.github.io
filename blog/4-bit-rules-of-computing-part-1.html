<p>Here is the second part of my series expanding on my
<a href="../pg/4-bit-rules.html">4-bit rules of computing</a>.</p>
<p>In this instalment:  Rules 4 to 7 (the third bit), which is mainly about 
documentation and experiments.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>
<strong>Rule 4</strong>: If you're exploring, keep a notebook/journal</h3>
<p>(or, indeed, a blog)</p>
<p>One of the undergrad modules in my 
<a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/computing-information-systems">UTas</a> degree was 
Computer Security, and as well as the dreary, dry textbooks I've forgotten 
about, we read <em>The Cuckoo's Egg</em> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo's_Egg">Clifford 
Stoll</a>. It's a fun read, and 
though the technical details are pretty dated now (it relates events from 
the 1980s), there's still a lot to learn — particularly about the value 
of applying the <strong>Scientific Method</strong> in your investigations, and of <em>keeping 
detailed notes</em>.</p>
<p>Cliff demonstrates that careful notes are valuable for at least these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To accurately record and recall what happened</li>
<li>Gather Data from experiments for detailed analysis</li>
<li>As evidence that a task was performed, or to support a hypothesis</li>
<li>As material to teach others</li>
</ul>
<p>I took a lot of Cliff's advice to heart — he's a <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/clifford_stoll_on_everything?language=en">genuine Doc 
Brown</a> and 
this book was very inspiring.</p>
<p>I have been following Cliff's advice for about 20 years now and I
firmly believe this to be the most important practice I picked up
during my Uni career.</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<insert picture of uni notes>&gt;&gt;</insert></p>
<p>Even if you don't keep your journal online (and there are
<a href="http://technicalblogging.com/why-every-professional-should-consider-blogging/">good arguments to blog online</a>
as well), you should <em>definately</em> keep some record of your
explorations and experiments.  It is so useful to be able to come back
to a project after an extended break and pick up what you were
thinking because you left careful notes.  I like to record the
following in my notes</p>
<ul>
<li>the date and time (I have automatic keys for this)</li>
<li>what are my goals?</li>
<li>concerns? where am I stuck?</li>
<li>a short plan for how to get unstuck</li>
<li>hypotheses for trouble-shooting. What data do I need? How will I get
  those?</li>
<li>outcome of experiments</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at these, they form the basis of what we are taught in High
School Science class about recording experiments, aren't they? I often
find that the discipline of just writing down these things is helpful
in my problem solving, so that I have some structure about how to
aproach the problem, rather than just bash my head against the wall.</p>
<p>It helps that I can type almost as fast as I think now. Back when I
kept hand-written notes it was a pain (literally) to write this much
detail down, but I did it even then because it was helpful, and with a
detailed map of where I had come and was going, I almost never got
lost.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Rule 5</strong>: Comments considered harmful</h3>
<p>(embedded in code, as well as those on YouTube)</p>
<p>This
<a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2015/04/13/why-comments-are-stupid-a-real-example/">thought-provoking</a>
blog on <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com">Simple Programmer</a> got me
<a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">really worked up</a> to begin with.  It goes against
everything I've been taught and trained to believe.  Looking at the
feedback for it, it's clear I'm not alone.</p>
<p>But after I calmed down and <em>read it properly</em>, I came around, mostly
(but see Rule 6)….</p>
<p>While I'm not convinced that John successfully demonstrates his point,
I do follow his reasoning, and I agree with his principle that source
code <em>should</em> be speaking for itself, whenever it can; and that if you
are resorting to using embedded comments to <em>explain the logic or
implementation</em>, this should be a sign to rethink your approach. This
is mostly in line with Rule 2.</p>
<p>My own opinion about code comments now is to treat them in the same
vein that
<a href="http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rubinson/copyright_violations/Go_To_Considered_Harmful.html">Dijktra</a>
treated <code>GOTO</code>: avoid it <em>where you can</em>. If you are unfortunate
enough to be working in a language that does not have Doc-Comments, or
that is esoteric (like assembly, bash scripts, Perl, or JCL) then I
think you should be using comments <em>liberally</em>, just as assembly uses
conditional <code>JUMP</code> instructions.</p>
<p>But keep Rule 0 in mind.</p>
<p>I've also mentioned YouTube here. That's because I'm beginning to
doubt the value of "Web 2.0" as it appears in YouTwitFace and blog
comments. They are a great opportunity for engaging with your audience
and to facilitate feedback, but they are more likely a vector for
personal attack and flamage. I'm lucky to have not been much of a
victim of flame wars, but now that the Internet is mainstream, it's
become a real concern, especially for women.</p>
<p>For some things, it may be safest not to comment when you don't agree
with something online. At least Google+ has the Mute function, so we
can be cowards and run away, just not Anonymous Cowards….</p>
<h3>
<strong>Rule 6</strong>: but Doc-Comments are a Force for Good</h3>
<p>Doc-Comments are the language-supported documentation strings that can
optionally be added to function definitions. Examples are LISP
documentation strings, Javadoc strings, and Python's docstrings,
though they appear in many languages.</p>
<p>These really are a Force for Good. Every argument that John Sonmez has
about code comments can be refuted for doc-comments:</p>
<p><em>

<strong>Rule 7</strong>: Test it. Test it Again</h3>
