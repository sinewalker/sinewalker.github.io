<p>Here is the second part of my <a href="../tags/4-bit-rules">blog series</a> expanding on my
<a href="../pg/4-bit-rules.html">4-bit rules of computing</a>.</p>
<p>In this instalment:  Rule 4, on keeping a notebook or journal.</p>
<p>I had planned on including Rules 5,6 and 7 as well (that is, all of
the third bit, out of 4 bits), but it is taking me more time to write
up my thoughts about those other rules, and I want to get something out
roughly every week.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>
<strong>Rule 4</strong>: If you're exploring, keep a notebook/journal</h3>
<p><em>(or, indeed, a blog)</em></p>
<p>One of the undergrad modules in my 
<a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/computing-information-systems">UTas</a> degree was 
Computer Security, and as well as the dreary, dry textbooks I've forgotten 
about, we read <em>The Cuckoo's Egg</em> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo's_Egg">Clifford 
Stoll</a>. It's a fun read, and 
though the technical details are pretty dated now (it relates events from 
the 1980s), there's still a lot to learn — particularly about the value 
of applying the <strong>Scientific Method</strong> in your investigations, and of <em>keeping 
detailed notes</em>.</p>
<p>Cliff demonstrates that careful notes are valuable for at least these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To accurately record and recall what happened</li>
<li>Gather data from experiments for detailed analysis</li>
<li>As evidence that a task was performed, or to support a hypothesis</li>
<li>As material to teach others</li>
<li>A place to organise paths of inquiry</li>
</ul>
<p>I took a lot of Cliff's advice to heart — he's a
<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/clifford_stoll_on_everything?language=en">genuine Doc Brown</a>
and his book was very inspiring.  Having kept lab notes for about 20
years now, I firmly believe this to be <strong><em>the</em></strong> <em>most important
practice</em> I picked up during my University career.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even if you don't keep your notebook online (and there are
<a href="http://technicalblogging.com/why-every-professional-should-consider-blogging/">good arguments for technical blogging</a>),
you should <em>definately</em> keep some record (in a computer!) of your
explorations and experiments.  It is such a relief and a boon to leave
a project aside and know that you will be <em>able</em> to come back to it
after an extended break and pick up were you left off — and what
you were thinking — because you left careful, searchable notes.</p>
<p>I like to record the following in my notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The date and time (I have key bindings for this in Emacs)</li>
<li>What are my goals?</li>
<li>Hypotheses.  What data do I need?  How will I get those?</li>
<li>Steps for setting up build/test/run apparatus</li>
<li>Procedures for experiments</li>
<li>Outcome of experiments</li>
<li>Conclusions</li>
<li>Concerns?  Where am I stuck or what don't I understand?</li>
<li>A short plan for how to get unstuck</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at these, they pretty much mirror what we are taught in High
School Science class about keeping lab notes, don't they? </p>
<p>I often find that the discipline of writing down these things is
helpful in my problem solving so that I have some structure about how
to approach the goal, rather than just bashing my head against a wall.</p>
<p>It helps that I can type almost as fast as I think now (yeah yeah, I'm
not <em>that</em> fast at typing…).  Back when I kept hand-written
notes it was a pain (literally) to write this much detail down, but I
did it even then because it was helpful, and with a detailed map of
where I had come and was going, I almost never got lost.</p>

<p>This physical notebook is a lovely thing to have, but today I
recommend that you save your wrist as well as your wits and keep an
electronic journal or notebook.  You'll be able to search it, and read
it.  If you like hand-drawing diagrams, then you can still do that and
either cross-reference a physical notebook against your electronic
notes, or else scan you drawings into the computer.</p>
<p>Do you keep notes while you explore?  What tools do you use, and how
do you structure your notes?</p>
