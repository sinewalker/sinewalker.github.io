*This is my own 2009 recipe, based on traditional Texan chilli with some*
*other ideas from Mexican chilli's I've enjoyed. Texans will complain*
*that it's not chilli if it has beans, so they're optional.*

Ingredients:
----

  - 1 to 1.5kg **lean beef**, coarsely ground (minced) or small cubes
  - 1 **onion**, chopped
  - 1 tablespoon **olive oil** (or light cooking oil)
  - 5 cups **water**
  - 1 can (420g) **mixed beans** in liquid (or, 1 more cup water)
  - 2 **bay leaves**
  - 1 sprig **rosemary**, leaves left on
  - 1 teaspoon **oregano leaves**, crushed (just pluck and bash fresh)
  - 8 to 10 cloves **garlic**, minced

  - 1/2 cup **fresh chopped chillis** medium to hot
  - 1/2 tablespoon **chilli powder**
  - 2 tablespoons **dried chilli flakes**
  - 1 teaspoon **ground cumin**
  - 2 teaspoons **ground cayenne pepper** (or 3 if you dare)
  - 3 tablespoons **smoked paprika**

  - 1/2 teaspoon **black pepper**
  - 1 tablespoon **salt**
  - 1 tablespoon **sugar**

  - 3 tablespoons **flour** (plain wheat)
  - 6 tablespoons **cornflour** ("cornmeal")
  - **cold water**

Preparation:
----

In a 5-6 litre saucepan or a large dutch oven, brown beef with onion
in oil. Add water, beans (or more water), bay leaves, rosemary sprig
(yep, that's the *unforgetable* part),
oregano, garlic, chillis and spices, salt and sugar. Simmer, covered, 2
hours. Cool. You can serve it now but it's got some *serious*
kick. Refrigerate or leave covered on the bench overnight so that
flavors will combine and mellow.

Skim off the solidified fat. Reheat.

If too much liquid, combine flour, cornflour and a little cold water
to make a smooth paste.  Add paste mixture to chilli. Cook, stirring,
for about 6 to 8 minutes longer.

Remove bay leaves and rosemary twig before serving. Add more chilli for
extra kick if too mild.

**Serves 6.**
