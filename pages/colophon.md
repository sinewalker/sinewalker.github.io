Introductions
----

My name is Mike Lockhart, and this is my web log. I am a senior support sysadmin
and larval web hacker for a well known Australian Open Source web content
management company. I do mainly Linux and
[Matrix](http://www.squiz.net/au/platform/matrix) work, and dabble in some other
languages and projects in my *Copious Free Time*. Before this, I worked for
nearly 15 years in EDS and Hewlett Packard on lots of different systems.


I live in [Tasmania](http://discovertasmania.com.au), where I grew up, returning
here from New South Wales, in late 2013 with my family (my lovely wife
[Jenny](http://www.pinterest.com/jen2779/), [three sons](http://xkcd.com/946)
and a dog). We all feel very lucky to be living here, with family close at hand
and an awesome, friendly and welcoming community around us.

This web
----

*On this web site you will find posts, pages, pictures and code that is in*
*connection with my interests. I try to keep the stuff here as general*
*as possible &mdash; any work-specific writings live behind a company*
*firewall. This means that what you see and read here is (or* ***was*** *) my*
*own opinion and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or directions*
*of my employers (past, present or future).*


This is the third iteration of my blog. The [archive](/archive/archive.html) has
old posts that I've migrated from [blogger](http://sinewalker.blogspot.com.au/)
and [wordpress](https://sinewalker.wordpress.com/), though those are still
online to be read in their original form. On the Net, I go by the handle
*sinewalker*, and while after 20 years I think I've outgrown it, it's still a
[unique username](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sinewalker) in most places.

**20160912 - I've decided to remove the comment system (Google Plus)**: No-one
comments anyway, and it adds heaps to the site load time and bandwidth. There's
not much point in costing visitors that overhead for something that isn't used.

How this web site is made
----

Posts are typed using the
[Dvorak keyboard](http://milosophical.me/tags/dvorak.html) layout into
[Emacs](http://spacemacs.org/) on either a PowerBook Mac, or a computer running
[openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org), usually on a
[Truly Ergonomic Computer Keyboard](https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/truly-ergonomic-mechanical-ergonomic-keyboard)
or a [Sun Type 6 keyboard](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Sun_Type_6) with
rearranged key caps.

Posts are generated from a mix of markup languages (typically
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or
[iPython](http://ipython.org/) [Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)),
using the [Nikola](http://getnikola.com) static web site and blog generator, and
published to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (via Nikola's
`github_deploy` command). The site is reachable via my own DNS, or the GitHub
one: http://sinewalker.github.com

The [source markup](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/tree/src)
files and Nikola configuration are stored in my GHP repository on the `src` branch.
