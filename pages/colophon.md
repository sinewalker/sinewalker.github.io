# Introductions

My name is Mike Lockhart, and this is my web log. I am a senior support sysadmin
and larval web hacker for a well known Australian Open Source web content
management company. I do mainly Linux
and [Matrix](http://www.squiz.net/au/platform/matrix) work, and dabble in some
other languages and projects in my *Copious Free Time*. 

I'm also married for 19 years and we are parents to three boys aged
between 5 and 12 years. We live in [Tasmania](http://discovertasmania.com.au),
where we grew up, returning here from New South Wales, in late 2013. We all feel
very lucky to be living here, with family close at hand and an awesome, friendly
and welcoming community around us.

On the Net, I go by the handle *sinewalker*, and while after 20 years I think
I've outgrown it, it's still a [unique
username](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sinewalker) in most places. A newer handle
I'm adopting is *milohax*.

My ACIC background check is held at [CVCheck](http://ww1.cvcheck.com/go/y4XPc63).

This web
----

*On this web site you will find posts, pages, pictures and code that are in*
*connection with my interests.  I try to keep the stuff here as general*
*as possible &mdash; any work-specific writings live behind a company*
*firewall.  This means that what you see and read here is (or* ***was*** *) my*
*own opinion and does not necessarily reflect the opinions or directions*
*of my employers (past, present or future).*


This is the third iteration of my blog. The [archive](/archive/archive.html) has
old posts that I've migrated from [blogger](http://sinewalker.blogspot.com.au/)
and [wordpress](https://sinewalker.wordpress.com/), though those are still
online to be read in their original form.

A major reason for building my blog with a static web page generator is so that
I can have fine control over type-setting. While this site is mainly a personal
blog (and so informal), I use notational conventions throughout. These are
common enough in online technical writings for the computer field but weirdly
not well supported by systems such as Blogger or Wordpress (or Matrix) which you
must fight against to use. Computer keywords are typed inline `like this`, terms
and variables are italicised *like that* and code blocks use *Colour Syntax
Highlightng*. At least for the newer posts since late 2015. I may go back and
tidy old migrated posts.

You will notice that the English on this site follows Commonwealth conventions of
grammar and spelling. That's a natural consequence of where I live. You will
also notice frequent spelling errors which are *not* attributable to
Commonwealth English -- that's a consequence of [Rule 9](/pg/4-bit-rules.html).
I've also recently adopted
the [Oxford Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) for its clarity
and consistency.

Contacting me
----

This is not a "web 2.0" site: there are no comments enabled here. No-one
comments anyway, and it adds a lot to the site load time and bandwidth. There's
not much point in costing visitors that overhead for something that isn't used.

Instead you should feel free to contact me [on Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/+MichaelLockhart), follow me [on GitHub](https://github.com/sinewalker) or by
[e-mail](mailto:sinewalker@gmail.com), to share your thoughts.

Sensitive data may be emailed to me using my public key with fingerprint
[3CCA2E6EBCBE8795](https://keybase.io/sinewalker/key.asc) (keybase.io).

How this web site is made
----

Posts are typed using
the [Dvorak keyboard](/tags/dvorak.html) layout
into [Emacs](/tags/emacs.html) on either an Apple PowerBook Mac, or a home
made computer running [openSUSE](http://www.opensuse.org), usually on
a
[Truly Ergonomic Computer Keyboard](https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/truly-ergonomic-mechanical-ergonomic-keyboard) or
a [Sun Type 6 keyboard](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Sun_Type_6) (grey version, with rearranged key caps).

Posts are generated from a mix of markup languages (typically
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or
[iPython](http://ipython.org/) [Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)),
using the [Nikola](http://getnikola.com) static web site and blog generator, and
published to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (via Nikola's
`github_deploy` command). The site is reachable via my own DNS, or the GitHub
one: [http://sinewalker.github.com](http://sinewalker.github.com).

The [source markup](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/tree/src)
files and Nikola [configuration](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/blob/src/conf.py) are stored in my [GHP repository](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io) on the `src` branch.

The repository [wiki](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/wiki) and [issues log](https://github.com/sinewalker/sinewalker.github.io/issues?q=) are where I keep notes about the site itself, rather than fill this site with [meta-blog](/tags/meta.html) posts.
