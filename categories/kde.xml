DARY" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/"&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager"&gt;tiling window manager&lt;/a&gt; as a replacement to KDE's &lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWin"&gt;kwin&lt;/a&gt;, and I've managed to hack together a recipe for getting them up an running. It's surprisingly simple, although the learing curve was a little steep.


This post documents what I've done to get things working nicely with the basic awesome config. No customisations here, see the &lt;a title="Awesome's wiki" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;awesome wiki&lt;/a&gt; for some &lt;a title="Customising Awesome" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Main_Page#Customization"&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;

After living in emacs for a few years I've come to appreciate it's &lt;a title="What's LCARS?" href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/LCARS"&gt;LCARS&lt;/a&gt; style of window panels, so I started to investigate arranging windows at a more global level in my X desktop. I discovered &lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager"&gt;tiling window managers&lt;/a&gt; and started researching them. I decided I want a light-weight, no-fuss tiling window manager for many reasons, not least being that overlapping windows become a mess, and the computer should really be taking care of arranging windows for me.  So I investigated several, narrowing down to &lt;a title="Written in Haskel, not too bad" href="http://xmonad.org"&gt;xmonad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Window Manager Improved 2" href="http://wmii.suckless.org"&gt;wmii&lt;/a&gt; and finally settling on &lt;a title="This is gonna be LEGEN ... wait for it ... DARY" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/"&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt;.



However I still like the general KDE environment with all it's facilities like &lt;a title="The semantic desktop" href="http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main1/"&gt;Nepomuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Plasma" href="http://plasma.kde.org/"&gt;Plasma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a title="KDE Desktop COmmunications Protocol" href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/other/dcop.html"&gt;DCOP&lt;/a&gt;, knotify  integration, &lt;a title="KDE Plasma desktop Run Command" href="http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner"&gt;krunner&lt;/a&gt;, hooks to Firefox and the trash can and so on -- all tools I can't live without. So I don't want to give  up KDE altogether just to have a better window manager. What I really want to do is run the KDE environment, but use awesome instead of kwin to manage my windows. If I can keep the eye-candy of transparent windows then that'd be a bonus.



After a week-end of research and hacking, here are my results.

&lt;h2&gt;Installing awesome&lt;/h2&gt;

This is a cinch on openSUSE, and probably also on most distro's.  In openSUSE I just used the &lt;a title="Webpin integrated into Yast" href="http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Research/YaST_Interface_for_Webpin"&gt;Webpin&lt;/a&gt; module in YaST to find &lt;a title="awesome packages in the OBS" href="https://build.opensuse.org/search/search"&gt;a package&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a title="OpenSUSE Build Service - for end-users, this is akin to Ubunto/Debian Universe" href="https://build.opensuse.org/"&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; and then installed that directly from the Webpin module, which added the repository and downloaded and installed the packages for me.



Once installed, this gives an additional Session type on the kdm login screen, which is neat for testing or using awesome by itself, but when you launch KDE it's still the same (as you would expect!)

&lt;h2&gt;Replacing the KDE window manager&lt;/h2&gt;

After some searching on a few forums I found that KDE's window manager can be set by putting the following into a script in the per-user KDE environment directory (&lt;code&gt;~/.kde4/env&lt;/code&gt; for KDE4)

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;KDEWM=/usr/bin/awesome&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This has the advantage that it only affects you, not everyone on the system who runs KDE.  Also it's easy to turn off and get the original kwin back if you want to.  I may look into adding KDE+awesome as a session type and then having a separate section in my &lt;code&gt;~/.xinitrc&lt;/code&gt; in the future if I'll be swapping back more often.  I don't anticipate it today though.

&lt;h2&gt;Fixing Java&lt;/h2&gt;

There is a &lt;a title="Java reparinting window bug" href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6429775"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in Java 1.5 and 1.6 where it makes protocol assumptions that are not true in non-reparanting window managers (something along those lines anyway).  It results in Java GUIs appearing as just a grey box in certain window managers like xgl, dwm, wmii, xmonad and awesome. &lt;a title="awesome tip to fix grey Java windows" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Problems_with_Java"&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt; this'll be fixed in Java 1.7. In the mean-time, to fix it for 1.5 and 1.6 you can install a utility called &lt;a title="wmname" href="http://tools.suckless.org/wmname"&gt;wmname&lt;/a&gt; (I used Webpin again) and then put this in a script to run at start-up (i.e. in &lt;code&gt;~/.kde4/Autostart&lt;/code&gt;)

&lt;pre style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh

/usr/bin/wmname LG3D

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

The "LG3D" window manager name above is one of the strings that 1.5 and 1.6 JVMs look for and change their behavior if found. This value is the name of the&lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass"&gt; LookingGlass3D&lt;/a&gt; window manager, by Sun. Appreciate the irony...

&lt;h2&gt;Composite effects (transparency and shadows)&lt;/h2&gt;

I found &lt;a title="explains xcompmgr and setting it up" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xcompmgr"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; on the ArchLinux wiki. It's very useful and describes how to enable &lt;a title="Enabling composite extension in Xorg 7.1+" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Composite"&gt;composite&lt;/a&gt; effects by default in your Xorg, and includes a &lt;a title="start/stop xcompmgr" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xcompmgr#Starting.2FStopping_xcompmgr_on_Demand"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; to turn effects on and off (quite useful on my aging AthlonXP  + Radeon, which can &lt;em&gt;only just&lt;/em&gt; handle the effects, but works nice and snappy without them).



With all this done I have a nice stable and useful desktop which I can begin to tweak when I get a chance to play with the Lua language that Awesome is configured with.

It is pretty interesting, but the best quote was at the end:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I often rant about how in all disruptive technologies, trends are always the same. Whether with the automobile, railroads, telephony or computers. A dominant company establishes ubiquity, but eventually competition settles in. Can you believe that Fords and Chevys can drive on the same roads and use the same gas? What a miracle of modern science that an AT&amp;amp;T user could call a Sprint user on the phone? A TGV and ICE train can ride on the same tracks? Madness! I can plug a lamp into the wall that my power company didn’t sell me? Now that’s what I call progress.

Why would computing be any different? I can’t believe that some choose to write software for a large audience that isn’t cross platform, browser-based or interoperable - but some do. Over time, proprietary file formats will go from being a competitive advantage to disadvantage. Heterogeneous systems are the norm and expected in every industry. It’s just tough being patient in ours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whatever your views on OOXML or Linux or Apple or DRM or FOSS/Proprietary software, or other contentious issues in the IT  industry, you've got to admit, these are pretty sensible aims.</description><category>GUI</category><category>KDE</category><category>alternatives</category><category>computers</category><category>quote</category><category>thoughts</category><category>useability</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/08/30/hetrogeneous-operating-environments-considered-normal.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 30 Aug 2007 01:47:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Kubuntu kaboose</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/05/16/kubuntu-kaboose.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I've joined the ubuntu train, and I'm travelling in the Kubuntu car (the caboose?).


This will be, what, my &lt;strong&gt;fifth &lt;/strong&gt;(or sixth if you count Knoppix, but I never put that on my hard drive) Linux distro since trying out RedHat 5.2 back in 1999.  Previous to this I was using openSUSE 10.2 which is not a bad distro either and I always had my eye on SuSE.  So, why yet another distro change?



&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;openSUSE's YaST tool.  It's sssoooo sssllloooowww.  Even Gentoo's Portage is faster for installing software, and &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;has to compile the programs from source code!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ZMD doesn't work.  It keeps breaking, crashing or going ballistic with the CPU&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is with all the susefications?  I really don't like the system menu in openSUSE and couldn't  find a way to turn it off&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some vital programs don't run:  Rosegarden and Google Earth lock up, FlightGear just won't run&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Like others in the community, I am grateful to Novell for what they have done in their fight with SCO, but unsure about their deal with Microsoft.  I like to think that perhaps the CEO is just a little naïve about M$ (or hasn't been bitten by them like me — I don't trust the Novell version of OpenOffice to be hands-off on my document, and not fiddle the format somehow)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

It is a shame since I do really like openSUSE, but this issue, together with the technical nags has tipped me over the edge and I'm moving on.



So, like was &lt;a title="Comment on " href="http://sinewalker.wordpress.com/2006/01/24/linux-distro-woes/#comments"&gt;suggested to me&lt;/a&gt; a bit over a year ago,  I'm switching to Kubuntu.  It's the latest favourite distro and has good reviews, from &lt;a title="aseigo - key KDE developer" href="http://aseigo.blogspot.com/"&gt;people &lt;/a&gt;I &lt;a title="canllaith - KDE documentor" href="http://www.canllaith.org/"&gt;respect &lt;/a&gt;in the KDE community, so my initial fears a year ago about it's KDE support being sub-par would seem to be unfounded.



I have to say:  switching to kubuntu has been the easiest Linux distro migration I have ever undertaken in eight years! Twenty minutes to install on my three-year-old home-built PC (Athlon XP1800+, 512MiB RAM, IDE drives, Radeon rv280 GPU and a 48cm LCD, plus other bits). Also, this is the first time that I've been able to surf the Net while an operating system installs itself! Yes, most Linuxen let you switch to another VT and run console programs, but no other installer I've seen lets you run a graphical KDE session while it installs, which is impressive and also very useful — I can read the installation manual on the Net while I install, no need to print it out or have a second computer running to one side.



Package installation is a breeze, and Feisty comes with the "universe" and "multiverse" repositories enabled, so getting "restricted formats" working took 10 minutes, and the installer was smart enough to configure APT to use a local mirror in Australia too! Very fast and very cool.



And to top it off:  Google Earth works and Beryl was a snap to install compared to getting Compiz working properly in SUSE.  I haven't tried Rosegarden yet (there's a lot of audio and JACK stuff to set up for it first) but even if that still won't work, Kubuntu's already working better than SUSE on my hardware.  Very satisfied.</description><category>KDE</category><category>Unix</category><category>alternatives</category><category>hacking</category><category>kubuntu</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/05/16/kubuntu-kaboose.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2007 22:53:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Remote desktop access on SuSE: Cygwin, X, XDMCP and SSH?  Nope.  FreeNX!</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/03/22/remote-desktop-acces-suse-cygwin-x-and-xdmcp.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;strong&gt;MJL20080827 -- Update&lt;/strong&gt;:  I Just realised that this is one of my top-visited pages and it's a totally disorganised and incongruent pile of... What's worse is, I've never updated it since the promised update back in March 2007!


Let me clear things up (and save you wading through the whole article): If you want remote access to your openSUSE desktop from a networked thin client, then forget about X11, XDMCP, VNC or tunneling X through SSH. Use the &lt;a title="Nomachine's intro to NX" href="http://nomachine.com/documentation/html/intr-technology.html"&gt;NX&lt;/a&gt; protocol. You'll need to do the following:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;a title="FreeNX -- an opensource implementation of an NX protocol server" href="http://freenx.berlios.de/"&gt;FreeNX&lt;/a&gt; on your openSUSE host. Some (slightly outdated, but usable) instructions are in Chapter 9 of the &lt;a title="openSUSE 10.2 Reference manual (PDF)" href="http://www.novell.com/documentation/opensuse102/pdfdoc/opensuse102_reference/opensuse102_reference.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;openSUSE 10.2 Reference manual&lt;/a&gt;. If you're using openSUSE 11.0 or newer, &lt;a title="FreeNX" href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.0&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;q=FreeNX"&gt;get the latest FreeNX package&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a title="All about openSUSE Build Service" href="http://build.opensuse.org/"&gt;openSUSE Build Service&lt;/a&gt; (there are &lt;a title="openSUSE one-click install standard" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Standards/One_Click_Install"&gt;one-click install&lt;/a&gt; buttons)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install an NX client on your remote terminal(s). &lt;a title="Nomachine home page" href="http://www.nomachine.com/"&gt;Nomachine&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a title="Nomachine's downloads page" href="http://www.nomachine.com/download.php"&gt;free NX clients&lt;/a&gt; for Linux, Mac, Windows and Solaris (even some experimental ones for PlayStation 2 and Zaurus!). If your remote terminal is running openSUSE, you could alternatively &lt;a title="Free NX client from OBS" href="http://software.opensuse.org/search?baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.0&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;q=freenx-client"&gt;get an open-source NX client&lt;/a&gt; from the build service (or ask yourself: I'm running X locally, so why don't I just use good ole SSH and X11?)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Configure your NX client to connect to the openSUSE host, then log in and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The upshot: &lt;/strong&gt;I've done this with a FreeNX server and Nomachine's NX client for Windows XP, and it all "just works", except maybe for some font issues with older X clients like emacs (install extra font packages from nomachine to fix that), and some transparency effect issues I noticed in kwin4, probably to do with X11 extensions missing in the NX client. Not a big deal.



Read the rest of this article for the boring background and laughable false-starts in my quest for remote desktops in X... &amp;lt;blush/&amp;gt;



&lt;!--more--&gt;



...



What I would &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;love to be able to do is get a graphical log-in screen to my openSUSE box, and have the &lt;a title="KDE Screenshots (Google)" href="http://images.google.com.au/images?q=kde%20screenshot&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;aq=t&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;tab=wi"&gt;KDE &lt;/a&gt;environment displayed onto a single window within the WinXP desktop on the notebook (sort of like Windows' Remote Desktop feature &lt;code&gt;mstsc.exe&lt;/code&gt;, or the original &lt;a title="X Terminal (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_terminal"&gt;X Terminals&lt;/a&gt; we used when I was a student at &lt;a title="School of Computing, University of Tasmania" href="http://www.comp.utas.edu.au"&gt;UTas&lt;/a&gt; back in the nineties).  This way I'd have my full KDE desktop &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;it'd be really comfy to use.  So what do I need to do?



Okay, I've finally had enough time at home  to play with connecting to my &lt;a title="openSUSE home" href="http://en.opensuse.org/Welcome_to_openSUSE.org"&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt; box from my work's laptop (WinXP) over my wireless LAN.  It's all groovy:  I can use &lt;a title="PuTTY home" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/"&gt;PuTTY&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a title="Cygwin download mirrors" href="http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html"&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; command (&lt;code&gt;ssh -Y&lt;/code&gt; to enable X11 tunnelling) to log in, list files, run programs (even X clients, so long as I've started Cygwin's X server first) and it's all secured by an &lt;a title="OpenSSH home" href="http://www.openssh.org/"&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt; tunnel through the air between my study and my back deck (favorite place to work :-) ).  Note that using &lt;a title="Wireless standard 802.11b (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11#802.11g"&gt;802.11g&lt;/a&gt; is probably a little slow for running intensely graphical X clients like photo viewers or &lt;a title="Xaos fractal zoomer home" href="http://wmi.math.u-szeged.hu/xaos/doku.php"&gt;&lt;code&gt;xaos&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ( :-) ), even with a strong signal, but it's good for running an IDE or &lt;a title="Konquerer (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konquerer"&gt;Konquerer&lt;/a&gt;.  And if you add the &lt;code&gt;-C &lt;/code&gt;(Compress) switch to &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;, it speeds up the intense app's nicely!



Well, obviously I'll need to start X on the WinXP box, without &lt;code&gt;-multiwindow&lt;/code&gt;, and to &lt;code&gt;-query&lt;/code&gt; for an &lt;a title="X Display Manager Control Protocol (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xdmcp"&gt;XDMCP&lt;/a&gt; server on the openSUSE box.  This should work, since I use a graphical login on openSUSE, which means an XDMCP server is already running (KDM).  So I' tried that, and it doesn't work. Why?



It turns out that nearly every Linux distro' has configured their X display managers (kdm, xdm or gdm) to &lt;em&gt;disable &lt;/em&gt;XDMCP access from external servers and instead only allows connections from &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. from the Linux machine itself).



Why have they done that?  Because XDMCP is insecure:  it transmits passwords in clear.  Also, you cannot secure XDMCP with SSH, as XDMCP uses UDP as well as TCP protocols :-( .  So it's insecure and it cannot be fixed, therefore distribution providers (wisely) disable it.  If I want to have a remote &lt;em&gt;desktop&lt;/em&gt; as opposed to just seeing individual &lt;em&gt;windows&lt;/em&gt; in my Windows desktop (which is cool, but not what I want), then I'll need to either not use SSH and be insecure, or use something else like &lt;a title="Tight VNC -- free VNC server/client" href="http://www.tightvnc.com/"&gt;VNC&lt;/a&gt;.



I'm going to opt for the (insecure) option of not using SSH for X desktop access, and stick to traditional XDMCP sessions.  My reasons for this are:

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I want it to be &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;, and with as little overhead as possible (using VNC involves mucking about with session IDs, or &lt;a href="http://www.linux-mag.com/id/1311?r=s"&gt;running an extra X server on the Linux side&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I only intend to access my Linux desktop from within my (W)LAN.  I have a firewall in the router, so I can set it to disallow access to ports UDP/177 and TCP/6000 from the Internet (or, if it proves too difficult to do it at the router, I can set openSUSE's own firewall to do that)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My WLAN is encrypted  over the air anyway (WPA/PSK) and it's also using a silent SSID &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a MAC-address white-list, so it's pretty secure already.  The only way for somebody to sniff out my password is to be physically attached to my router&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;So far I feel I can trust every computer attached to the LAN, since it's my own house.  If (&lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt;?) this changes (that is, once my son is old enough to hack the network, so maybe when he's about eight years old?), I might revisit tunneling XDMCP sessions via VNC through SSH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

So, how do you set up good ole' XDMCP under Linux? &lt;a title="Linux XDMCP HOWTO (The Linux Documentation Project)" href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/XDMCP-HOWTO/"&gt;READ THE FINE HOW-TO&lt;/a&gt;.  It's that simple, just remember that this is &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;secure kids.  If you need security, use VNC, or just &lt;code&gt;ssh -Y&lt;/code&gt; to your Linux host and run individual X clients (with an X server on your local machine). I've also read &lt;a title="Cygwin X-Free mailing list archive" href="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin-xfree/2004-06/msg00204.html"&gt;in a mailing list&lt;/a&gt; that it's possible to start KDE from an SSH session anyway.  I might give that a go first, since it would be nearly as simple as XDMCP, and also secure.  But I really want my desktop, so we'll see what happens first….



&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2007-03-26T08:22+1000 Update: &lt;/strong&gt; — Some mixed success



I've learned a couple of things over the week-end:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt; ssh -&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline;"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;Y&lt;/code&gt; (use gzip compression when transmitting packets) produces satisfactory speed for &lt;code&gt;xaos&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;gwenview&lt;/code&gt;, even over my WLAN&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;PuTTY doesn't seem to work any faster, even with Compression Enabled. Perhaps it doesn't support OpenSSL's compression?  I don't know.  Anyway, I don't need PuTTY as long as I have Cygwin with &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can start the KDE desktop from an &lt;code&gt;ssh&lt;/code&gt; session with the &lt;code&gt;startkde&lt;/code&gt; command.  However in openSUSE (at least my install) this takes a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to start, and eventually &lt;code&gt;kwin&lt;/code&gt; hangs on the notebook end.  On the client end (the openSUSE box), it maxes out the CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

So that was exciting and a little disappointing.  I'll need to experiment a little more it seems.  I got expected warnings about missing font paths and ALSA not working, but I was still hoping to get the desktop up, just with some reduced functionality.  There were also warnings about certain X server extensions being unavailable on the Cygwin X server, which I didn't expect, but again, they aren't critical (no transparency support etc.).  Perhaps there's some environment variables that KDM sets which are causing kwin or other desktop subsystems some grief when missing?



If I still can't get it working soon, I might start with XDMCP, or I might skip straight to VNC after all.  One other thing to try before getting too drastic is to see if the Linux on my notebook's VMWare can run my KDE desktop remotely, or to try booting the notebook from a LiveCD such as Knoppix….



&lt;hr&gt;&lt;strong&gt; 2007-03-29T16:48+1000 Update: &lt;/strong&gt; — RTFM.  Indeed!



It's amazing what you can find out if you just read the manuals that come with your software.  Feeling silly now…I was exploring the &lt;a title="Novell openSUSE Reference manual (PDF)" href="http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/03/22/www.novell.com/documentation/opensuse102/pdfdoc/opensuse102_reference/opensuse102_reference.pdf"&gt;openSUSE Reference manual&lt;/a&gt; on the train home last night. Chapter nine is particularly interesting:  it describes FreeNX, a free remote desktop server, all ready to go on openSUSE, just install and follow the instructions.  There's even an &lt;a title="NX Client for Windows (NoMachine)" href="http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-windows.php"&gt;NX client for Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Much simpler, and still Free.



Looks like this is the way to go.  I'll try it out and do a (hopefully) final  update.</description><category>GUI</category><category>KDE</category><category>Unix</category><category>cygwin</category><category>freenx</category><category>hacking</category><category>how-to</category><category>linux</category><category>nomachine</category><category>nx</category><category>x11</category><category>xorg</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2007/03/22/remote-desktop-acces-suse-cygwin-x-and-xdmcp.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2007 02:59:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>"Safely Remove" a USB frob under SuSE/KDE</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/07/31/safely-remove-a-usb-fob-under-susekde.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;In vanila SuSE 10.0, safely removing a &lt;a title="Universal Serial Bus" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB"&gt;USB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="Hey, I like my term better than the one's other people have come up with..." href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive#Etymology"&gt;frob&lt;/a&gt; can be a trial for non-root users.  It's a shame, but I've found a fix that I'm 95% happy with.


&lt;!--more--&gt;Here's a screen shot showing how easy it is to remove a USB device in KDE (I wish Windows was this easy, instead of having to play "hunt for the Safely Remove icon in the Systray...")



&lt;a title="photo sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockhart/202572577/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/66/202572577_feca535e56_m.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockhart/202572577/"&gt;"Safely Remove" a USB frob under SuSE/KDE&lt;/a&gt;

Unfortunately, it doesn't work.  Instead of the icon disappearing (indicating you can pull out the frob safely), you get a nasty error:



&lt;a title="photo sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockhart/202572575/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/25/202572575_35fb9cda79_o.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockhart/202572575/"&gt;Umount - mtab entry missing error&lt;/a&gt;

After reading a few man pages and surfing for a bit, I found out that this error is generated by the &lt;code&gt;umount&lt;/code&gt; command.  The man page for &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; actually recommends replacing the &lt;code&gt;/etc/mtab&lt;/code&gt; file with a symlink to &lt;code&gt;/proc/mounts&lt;/code&gt; under Linux.  So I did that and tried again.  Here's what I got:



&lt;a title="photo sharing" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockhart/202572576/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/74/202572576_973f7f47d0_o.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lockhart/202572576/"&gt;Umount - fstab entry missing error&lt;/a&gt;

So, because &lt;code&gt;kio_media_mounthelper&lt;/code&gt; has helpfully mounted the frob under a mountpoint with the same name as the VFAT volume label (which is actually pretty cool!), &lt;code&gt;umount&lt;/code&gt; can't find this entry in &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; (not so cool).



&lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; is not supposed to be updated by machines, only people, so the work-around is to manually add entries for all of my USB frobs.  I only have two, so it's fairly easy:

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;



#MJL20060731 - the following were added to try to appease umount/kio_media_mounthelper for USB frobs:



/dev/sda1            /media/D_CHIP_00    subfs      noauto,fs=usbfs,users,nosuid 0 0



/dev/sda1            /media/D_CHIP_01    subfs      noauto,fs=usbfs,users,nosuid 0 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note:— I've done two things here:  added an entry for each of the USB frobs onto the &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda1&lt;/code&gt; device (which is type &lt;code&gt;subfs&lt;/code&gt;, because SuSE uses &lt;a title="submount home on SourceForge" href="http://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;amp;ct=res&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsubmount.sourceforge.net%2F&amp;amp;ei=Zp3ORJn1MIeKsAKp8rWtBA&amp;amp;sig2=m6wLzB71BjAKWrwSKUU8Mg"&gt;submount&lt;/a&gt; to mount removeable devices), and make it so that normal &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; can unmount.  It's also worth adding the &lt;code&gt;users&lt;/code&gt; flag to other removeable devices too, such as CD-ROMs, since &lt;code&gt;umount&lt;/code&gt; will complain about your not being root without it…



I see three problems with this:

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Any new frob I buy (or if I rename a frob volume) will need an entry in &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; before normal users an safely unmount it. Ugly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You have to be root to edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt;, so only &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;can add new frobs to the list. Inconvinient.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The way I've edited &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; to have both frobs on the one device, means I can only use one at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

A work-around for the 1st and 2nd gripes is to add a third entry to &lt;code&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; with a generic label, and always label my USB frobs that way.  Not sure if that is better or not.



So, I've found my first SuSE gripe.  It's nothing major, and it was not a big problem to find a solution or work-around that is actually liveable for day-to-day tasks and only becomes an issue occasionally.
