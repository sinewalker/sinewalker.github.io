One of the reasons I'm not posting very frequently (apart from just not having much to say or making time to say it) is that it is such a pain to write posts in WordPress' built in editor.  I briefly considered editing in a text editor and then cut/pasting, but usually there's a mess to clean up anyway, so it's not much fun either. &lt;/p&gt; 


&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I recently started looking for ways to blog offline in emacs and then publish posts up to WordPress. I won't say I was surprised to find more than one solution, but it was pleasant nonethelessâ€¦ :) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The one I'm using to write this post with is a package called &lt;a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog"&gt;org2blog&lt;/a&gt;. It supports WordPress posts via it's XML RPC interface and can publish to as many different WordPress blogs as you like.  This suits me because I also have an internal work blog at HP (they use WordPress MU, so it'll be interesting to find out how/if that works). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; You can configure it fairly easily with some elisp. Here's mine: &lt;/p&gt;    



[sourcecode language="text" light="true" highlight="12"]

;; Note - I installed org2blog with ELPA from Marmalade, so this

;; `require' declaration is probably just documentation



(require 'org2blog-autoloads)



(setq org2blog/wp-blog-alist
       '(("sinewalker"
          :url "http://sinewalker.wordpress.com/xmlrpc.php"
          :username "sinewalker"
          :default-categories ("hacking")
          :tags-as-categories nil
          :wp-code t)
         ("hp-hacks"

     &lt;p&gt; Note that the directive on line 12 is what causes the code above to be encased in Wordpress' &lt;a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/"&gt;sourcecode shortcut&lt;/a&gt;.  In my org version of this post, the code is surrounded by "#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp" and "#+END_SRC", which allows me to edit in emacs using emacs-lisp-mode, right inline of the rest of this post. Unfortunately the sourcecode shortcut in Wordpress doesn't understand emacs lisp, so there's no syntax highlighting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; There are still some things for me to figure out (such as how to mark code within the text of a paragraph, as above), but already this is looking a lot better. &lt;/p&gt; </description><category>emacs org-mode blogging code</category><category>hacking</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2011/12/15/blogging-with-emacs-org-mode.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Dec 2011 10:53:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
