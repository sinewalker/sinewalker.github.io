I braved the contempt of my friends last week and ventured out to see

"Bambi", the Disney rerelease that is proving to be a hit once again in the

box office. I was looking forward to a gentle, soothing, late afternoon

relief from the Washington Summer. Instead I was traumatized. As a

psycho-sexual return to the horrors of early adolescence, it couldn't be

more effective. For the first half-hour, you're lulled into an agreeable

sense of security and comfort. Birds twitter; small rabbits turn out to be

great conversationalists. Pop is what Senator Moynihan would describe as an

absent father, but Mom's there to make you feel OK in the odd thunderstorm.

You make great friends, fool around on the ice, discover the meadow,

generally mellow out. Then, without any particular warning, your mom gets

shot, your voice breaks, huge growths start appearing on your head, and

your peers start heading off into the clover with the apparent intention of

having sex. Next thing you know, the forest burns down. If I were still

eight, I think I'd prefer _Rambo III_."

The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new

When I was young, my family bought a color TV. Our neigbors, who were

poorer, had only a black-and-white set. They bought a piece of cellophane,

ARPAnet, CSnet, BITnet and USEnet are fellow travellers of a

brotherhood which has no name or formal organization. You can easily

DARY" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/"&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager"&gt;tiling window manager&lt;/a&gt; as a replacement to KDE's &lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWin"&gt;kwin&lt;/a&gt;, and I've managed to hack together a recipe for getting them up an running. It's surprisingly simple, although the learing curve was a little steep.


This post documents what I've done to get things working nicely with the basic awesome config. No customisations here, see the &lt;a title="Awesome's wiki" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;awesome wiki&lt;/a&gt; for some &lt;a title="Customising Awesome" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Main_Page#Customization"&gt;ideas&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rationale&lt;/h2&gt;

After living in emacs for a few years I've come to appreciate it's &lt;a title="What's LCARS?" href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/LCARS"&gt;LCARS&lt;/a&gt; style of window panels, so I started to investigate arranging windows at a more global level in my X desktop. I discovered &lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager"&gt;tiling window managers&lt;/a&gt; and started researching them. I decided I want a light-weight, no-fuss tiling window manager for many reasons, not least being that overlapping windows become a mess, and the computer should really be taking care of arranging windows for me.  So I investigated several, narrowing down to &lt;a title="Written in Haskel, not too bad" href="http://xmonad.org"&gt;xmonad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Window Manager Improved 2" href="http://wmii.suckless.org"&gt;wmii&lt;/a&gt; and finally settling on &lt;a title="This is gonna be LEGEN ... wait for it ... DARY" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/"&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt;.



However I still like the general KDE environment with all it's facilities like &lt;a title="The semantic desktop" href="http://nepomuk.semanticdesktop.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main1/"&gt;Nepomuk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a title="Plasma" href="http://plasma.kde.org/"&gt;Plasma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a title="KDE Desktop COmmunications Protocol" href="http://developer.kde.org/documentation/other/dcop.html"&gt;DCOP&lt;/a&gt;, knotify  integration, &lt;a title="KDE Plasma desktop Run Command" href="http://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner"&gt;krunner&lt;/a&gt;, hooks to Firefox and the trash can and so on -- all tools I can't live without. So I don't want to give  up KDE altogether just to have a better window manager. What I really want to do is run the KDE environment, but use awesome instead of kwin to manage my windows. If I can keep the eye-candy of transparent windows then that'd be a bonus.



After a week-end of research and hacking, here are my results.

&lt;h2&gt;Installing awesome&lt;/h2&gt;

This is a cinch on openSUSE, and probably also on most distro's.  In openSUSE I just used the &lt;a title="Webpin integrated into Yast" href="http://en.opensuse.org/YaST/Research/YaST_Interface_for_Webpin"&gt;Webpin&lt;/a&gt; module in YaST to find &lt;a title="awesome packages in the OBS" href="https://build.opensuse.org/search/search"&gt;a package&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a title="OpenSUSE Build Service - for end-users, this is akin to Ubunto/Debian Universe" href="https://build.opensuse.org/"&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; and then installed that directly from the Webpin module, which added the repository and downloaded and installed the packages for me.



Once installed, this gives an additional Session type on the kdm login screen, which is neat for testing or using awesome by itself, but when you launch KDE it's still the same (as you would expect!)

&lt;h2&gt;Replacing the KDE window manager&lt;/h2&gt;

After some searching on a few forums I found that KDE's window manager can be set by putting the following into a script in the per-user KDE environment directory (&lt;code&gt;~/.kde4/env&lt;/code&gt; for KDE4)

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;KDEWM=/usr/bin/awesome&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This has the advantage that it only affects you, not everyone on the system who runs KDE.  Also it's easy to turn off and get the original kwin back if you want to.  I may look into adding KDE+awesome as a session type and then having a separate section in my &lt;code&gt;~/.xinitrc&lt;/code&gt; in the future if I'll be swapping back more often.  I don't anticipate it today though.

&lt;h2&gt;Fixing Java&lt;/h2&gt;

There is a &lt;a title="Java reparinting window bug" href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6429775"&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in Java 1.5 and 1.6 where it makes protocol assumptions that are not true in non-reparanting window managers (something along those lines anyway).  It results in Java GUIs appearing as just a grey box in certain window managers like xgl, dwm, wmii, xmonad and awesome. &lt;a title="awesome tip to fix grey Java windows" href="http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Problems_with_Java"&gt;Apparently&lt;/a&gt; this'll be fixed in Java 1.7. In the mean-time, to fix it for 1.5 and 1.6 you can install a utility called &lt;a title="wmname" href="http://tools.suckless.org/wmname"&gt;wmname&lt;/a&gt; (I used Webpin again) and then put this in a script to run at start-up (i.e. in &lt;code&gt;~/.kde4/Autostart&lt;/code&gt;)

&lt;pre style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/bin/sh

/usr/bin/wmname LG3D

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

The "LG3D" window manager name above is one of the strings that 1.5 and 1.6 JVMs look for and change their behavior if found. This value is the name of the&lt;a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass"&gt; LookingGlass3D&lt;/a&gt; window manager, by Sun. Appreciate the irony...

&lt;h2&gt;Composite effects (transparency and shadows)&lt;/h2&gt;

I found &lt;a title="explains xcompmgr and setting it up" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xcompmgr"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; on the ArchLinux wiki. It's very useful and describes how to enable &lt;a title="Enabling composite extension in Xorg 7.1+" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Composite"&gt;composite&lt;/a&gt; effects by default in your Xorg, and includes a &lt;a title="start/stop xcompmgr" href="http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xcompmgr#Starting.2FStopping_xcompmgr_on_Demand"&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; to turn effects on and off (quite useful on my aging AthlonXP  + Radeon, which can &lt;em&gt;only just&lt;/em&gt; handle the effects, but works nice and snappy without them).



With all this done I have a nice stable and useful desktop which I can begin to tweak when I get a chance to play with the Lua language that Awesome is configured with. More toys to play with :)</description><category>KDE</category><category>awesome</category><category>desktop</category><category>geek</category><category>hacking</category><category>how-to</category><category>useability</category><category>xcompmgr</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2010/07/05/awesome-kde-java-composite-hacks.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2010 04:54:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>MS-Windows focus-follows-mouse Registry hacks</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2010/03/10/ms-windows-focus-follows-mouse-registry-hacks.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I like the "focus follows mouse" window-focussing model from X11, because
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I don't have to click on the window, just move the mouse and the window it's over is focussed&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I can focus a window &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; bringing it to the front, which is sometimes handy. If I want it in front, I can click it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

However MS-Windows follows the old-fashioned, Macintosh/Smalltalk style of having users click on a window to focus it for the keyboard. How do you make MS-Windows behave more like X11?



&lt;!--more--&gt;I used to install &lt;strong&gt;TweakUI &lt;/strong&gt;from Microsoft, just so that I could turn on an X11-like focus-follows-mouse mode, but Microsoft don't make TweakUI for Vista (there is &lt;strong&gt;TweakVI &lt;/strong&gt;instead, if you want to Google for it. It's by some other company. It's not bad, but overkill for what I want to do).



In Vista, Microsoft added a GUI for this mode that's &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; what I want. You can do this:



Open Control Panel (new view, not Classic)

&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;&amp;gt; Ease of Access Center&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:60px;"&gt;&amp;gt; Make the mouse easier to use&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="padding-left:90px;"&gt;&amp;gt; [ ] Activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse&lt;/p&gt;

But this also brings the window to the front when it's focussed.  If that's what you want, then you're done. If you're like me and you want the window under the mouse to have keyboard focus, but you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want it brought to the front without clicking on it, you'll need to hack the Windows Registry. Here are some steps, which should be good for any release of Windows that is based on Windows NT (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, Win7):

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;strong&gt;regedit &lt;/strong&gt;(Win+R, regedit, OK)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open up the key &lt;strong&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change the value of the REG_DWORD &lt;strong&gt;ActiveWindowTracking&lt;/strong&gt; to 0x0000001 (1)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Open up the key &lt;strong&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logical OR&lt;/strong&gt; the first byte of the REG_BINARY &lt;strong&gt;UserPreferencesMask&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;.  That is, if the current value is df 3e 03 80 12 00 00 00, then leave the 'df' alone. If it's 9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 03 07 80 12 00 00 00 , change it to 9&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;f&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;.. ..  and so on &lt;strong style="color:#7744ee;"&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;To make the focus a little slower, so that pop-up windows are useable, you also want to change the focus timing. Change the REG_DWORD &lt;strong&gt;ActiveWindTrkTimeout&lt;/strong&gt; (also in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop) to the number of milliseconds to wait before focus shifts to the window under the mouse.  I like a value of 0x00000080 (128ms). You might like 200ms (c8), or some faster or slower value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;strong style="color:#7744ee;"&gt;*&lt;/strong&gt; If you can't do this hexadecimal bit twiddling math in your head (difficult if you're not a programmer), then Windows' Calc can do it for you: put it in Programmer and Hex modes, type the first byte (hex pair e.g. 9e), press the 'Or' button, then '1' and the '=' button.  If the number changes, that's what you replace the first byte with. Thanks to Erik in the comments below, I've finally figured this out and (I hope) clarified what to do..



So, in summary, the Registry keys are as follows for X11-like window focus:

&lt;pre&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USERS\Control Panel\Mouse

  REG_DWORD ActiveWindowTracking = 0x00000001  (1)

HKEY_CURRENT_USERS\Control Panel\Desktop

  REG_DWORD ActiveWindTrkTimeout = 0x00000080  (128)

  REG_BINARY UserPreferencesMask OR= 01 .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..&lt;/pre&gt;

These registry hacks require a reboot to take effect.</description><category>desktop</category><category>geek</category><category>hacking</category><category>how-to</category><category>tip</category><category>useability</category><category>windows</category><category>x11</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2010/03/10/ms-windows-focus-follows-mouse-registry-hacks.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2010 03:42:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Asus kEeeboard -- way kewl</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2009/01/09/asus-keeeboard-way-kewl.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;Asus &lt;a title='Asuse Eee Keyboard, return to "home computers"?' href="http://stuff.tv/blogs/ces/archive/2009/01/07/ces-2009-the-asus-eee-keyboard-a-wafer-thin-media-centre.aspx"&gt;just unveiled their prototype Eee keyboard&lt;/a&gt; at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.


It looks so much like my first ever computer (an &lt;a title="Amstrad CPC" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_cpc"&gt;Amstrad CPC 6128&lt;/a&gt;). Check it out:

&lt;!--more--&gt;It also has some really neat features. I hope it gets marketed, I want one! Especially if it boots in under a second like the old 8-bit machines. I remember when the computer was ready before the CRT had even finished warming up... those were the days.

If there's a data error (not an XML parsing error) then you have to read it so that you can find where the error is, but you don't have XML-spy and NetBeans is overkill or takes forever to fire up...


Emacs to the rescue! &lt;a title="Benjamin Ferrari's blog (seems to lack an " href="http://blog.bookworm.at/"&gt;Benjamin Ferrari&lt;/a&gt; wrote this &lt;em&gt;increadibly useful&lt;/em&gt; (and simple) &lt;a title="Benjamin Ferrari's original blog post for below code" href="http://blog.bookworm.at/2007/03/pretty-print-xml-with-emacs.html"&gt;elisp function&lt;/a&gt; to pretty-print a block of XML code:

Then I Googled for "Microsoft Keyboard Vista" and found &lt;a title="Vista media keyboard??? (Microsoft)" href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/mouseandkeyboard/productdetails.aspx?pid=080"&gt;this ad from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a title="Vista media keyboard???

What the?  "Designed to make it easier than ever to control PC media from your desk, your lap–or even from the comfort of your couch".  So… if I use this keyboard's Play button to try and play media that Vista's &lt;a title="Digital Rights Management (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management"&gt;DRM&lt;/a&gt; system &lt;em&gt;thinks &lt;/em&gt;I shouldn't be playing, does it administer an electric shock?  What if I have the keyboard in my lap :-D  Ouch! No so &lt;em&gt;comfortable &lt;/em&gt;now…

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure this observation has been made elsewhere, but I can't find reference to it online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Have you ever noticed the prolific use of mystical/fantastical words in computer jargon? I'm sure there is a significance, or at least a tongue-in-cheek pointing to the wizardly ways of early and contemporary computer experts.  It is funny I suppose, and when you look at how wide-spread it is, it may be revealing of the hacker psych.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyway, here is a list I've compiled (mostly from the &lt;a href="http://www.jargon.org"&gt;Jargon File&lt;/a&gt;) of mystical/fantastical terms used in computing:

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer &lt;a title="how keyboards should work" href="http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/"&gt;Dvorak keyboards&lt;/a&gt;
  to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY"&gt;QWERTY&lt;/a&gt;, which confounds
  my work colleagues no end :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I've been typing on Dvorak for about 3 years now [&lt;em&gt;ed: That is, since
2003&lt;/em&gt;]. The main reason I use the Dvorak keyboard layout is because, after
15 years of six-finger typing on QWERTY, I decided to learn to touch-type, and
Dvorak is very easy to learn (I learnt it in 2 weeks, back to my old typing
speed after a month).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;



&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don't believe Dvorak makes me a faster typist inherently (though I am faster now that I can touch-type), but it's &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more comfortable and the shooting pains in my arms have gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/179/613/400/2350-1B.0.jpg" border="2" alt="My home keyboard is an A4 KBS23 wireless, very similar to this" align="left"&gt;At home, I use a slightly older model of the &lt;a href="http://www.A4Tech.com"&gt;A4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.a4tech.com/en/product2.asp?CID=2&amp;amp;SCID=14&amp;amp;MNO=KB%28S%29-2350ZRP"&gt;KB(S)-2350ZRP&lt;/a&gt; (pictured). I chose this keyboard over more &lt;a title="A4 2580RP — keypad at left makes mouse closer" href="http://www.a4tech.com/en/product2.asp?CID=2&amp;amp;SCID=14&amp;amp;MNO=KB%28S%29-2580RP"&gt;radical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="This is just so kewl, like something from seaQuest DSV" href="http://www.teleprint.com/"&gt;designs&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a title="I nearly bought one of these — may yet when I no longer need to share…" href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2295,contentid=6012,detail=1"&gt;I like&lt;/a&gt;, because the A4 2350 is not too different from a standard typewriter layout — so it plays nice with other people in the family.  The A-shaped keys help a lot with my lower-arm pains too, but not so much as the Dvorak layout, since most of the time I'm typing at work on a standard &lt;a href="http://www.dell.com"&gt;Dell &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a title="This keyboard is the same model as the one I use at work.  Ick" href="http://static.flickr.com/65/170195416_e3cba9cda7_o.png"&gt;SK-8125&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Making up strong passwords with this keyboard layout is much easier now.  Think
of a fairly good password (fee1bo7ch, for instance) and then type it on Dvorak
as-if you were typing on QWERTY (becomes u..1br7jd).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I'm thinking about teaching my left hand
to &lt;a href="http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/onehand.html"&gt;type one-handed&lt;/a&gt;
dvorak too, to improve my mousing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Issues I've encountered with Dvorak&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are some minor annoyances when you switch away from QWERTY.  Anybody in a minority group (such as left-handed people) will identify with some of these.  None of these issues have been serious enough to cause me to switch back to QWERTY though, as the benefits I've gained (typing speed, no more pain) far outweigh any of them, even all considered together.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Typing on someone else's QWERTY keyboard becomes very uncomfortable. I frequently shudder at the thought of having to touch someone's keyboard now (not because of hygiene, but it's the same feeling). I can still do it, and since I never learnt to type properly on QWERTY anyway, it's no trouble to look at the keyboard.  Years of familiarity with this layout means I don't need much reminding, so it's not like I have to hunt for keys, more like a mental changing of gears and putting up with awkward key combinations (like, for instance A-W-K-W-A-R-D)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the same vein, letting someone else use your keyboard can be fun!  Most operating systems allow an easy/quick way to switch layouts.  Windows sort-of does, but it only applies to the current window, not the whole system (what a stupid design!), so you need to remember that gotcha.  I sometimes use this as an opportunity to advocate Dvorak, but usually this is interpreted as “just Mike evangelising again…” ;-)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some programs and games make use of the QWERTY layout in selecting keyboard short-cuts.  For example, vi uses the H J K and L keys for cursor movement, since this arrangement is sensible in QWERTY.  On Dvorak, it's useless as those keys are located at the J C V and P positions.  But then again, &lt;a title="EMACS rules, vi drools" href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ViSucks"&gt;vi sucks&lt;/a&gt; anyway, so it's not a problem.  Winamp uses Z X C V and B for pause, playback and track selection functions, but it can be re-programmed, at least for the global shortcuts.  Some games suffer, so you need to switch back to QWERTY for them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Passwords can be tricky.  On systems that lock your account after too many bad tries, you have to be very confident that you know where the keys are!  An alternative is to use my password trick above, and always look at the keys when entering passwords.  This is accurate, but if you need to put in your password on a QWERTY keyboard, you have to know the real password, and not the easier QWERTY–Dvorak mapping you have memorised.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><category>dvorak</category><category>geek</category><category>keyboards</category><category>thoughts</category><category>tip</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/03/27/dvorak-keyboards.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2006 00:07:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Crashed Linux</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/03/24/crashed-linux.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;

This is a pretty neat shot of the in-flight entertainment system on an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A330"&gt;Airbus A330&lt;/a&gt; having a boot-up issue. Note, the kernel is Linux.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
This photo has a big rant in the flickr comments about whether or not it's a Linux crash. Well, what's a Linux crash? Most of the public Windows crashes do not involve the Windows kernel (except for blue-screens) but they get called Windows crashes. So, to be fair, this is a Linux crash, even if it appears that the kernel itself is fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>aircraft</category><category>geek</category><category>linux</category><category>observation</category><category>screenshot</category><guid>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/03/24/crashed-linux.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Mar 2006 03:11:22 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Alternatives for data transmission in over-secured areas</title><link>http://milosophical.me/blog/2006/03/09/alternatives-for-data-transmission-in-over-secured-areas.html</link><dc:creator>Mike Lockhart</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ietf.org"&gt;IETF &lt;/a&gt;(Internet Engineering Task Force)
  is the international community of network experts who have been designing the
  main Internet “standards” for the past 30 years or so.  These include such
  landmark standards
  as &lt;a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt?number=822"&gt;RFC822&lt;/a&gt;
  (email) and RFCs2045-2047 (MIME).  New standards continue to be published and
  implemented today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

Two IETF contributions may be especially helpful for our current issues at work in transferring data between two isolated systems.  For the published IETF documents, see:
