Decisions at work provided inspiration on the train to work this morning....


Sung to *Casino*

With apologies to Philadelphia Grand Jury

Aaarrggh

Gonna support AGIMO
Tomorrow night
Gonna support AGIMO
And make it right

What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?

Gonna support AGIMO
Tomorrow night
Gonna support AGIMO
Watch out they bite

What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?

Then it hits me ... Management lunacy
Then it hits me ... CMMI Level 3
Then it hits me ... No-one knows ...... but me!

Gonna support AGIMO
Tomorrow night
Gonna support AGIMO
It's fight-or-flight

go-go-go-go-go AGIMO
to-to-to tomorrow night!
go-go-go-go-go AGIMO
to-to-to tomorrow night!

What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?
What could possibly go wrong?

Then it hits me ... Eight weeks of "warranty"
Then it hits me ... Developers want to flee
Then it hits me ... No-one cares ...... not me!

ah-huh ok oh-no, uh-uh, no-no, won't go
oh no, uh-oh what the?

What's the hurry? We got no money
They don't care honey, so don't you worry
What's the hurry? We got no money
They don't care honey, so don't you worry

What's the hurry? We got no money
They don't care honey, so don't you worry
What's the hurry? We got no money
They don't care honey, so don't you worry

Say what?
Gonna to support AGIMO
