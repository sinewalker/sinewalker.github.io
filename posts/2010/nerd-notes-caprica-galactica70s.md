Nerd Notes (pun):

 TODO: stale links.  maybe try this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WITxJOxUqDg
 
 OR:  take sound bytes from both and put them on my own Sound Cloud account as a comparison piece.  Should be okay under "fair use" terms. Will have to check SC's terms.
 

Here is the music theme to the "Caprica" TV series:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gMCNuZANVo

 

Now, here is the Original Battlestar Galactica movie theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbvcZi_nXA&playnext=1&list=PLA9DA08CE43879E53

 

Check out about 8:50 to 9 minutes in, track 4, "ADAMA'S THEME". Pay attention to the line that the oboe plays, that is the same theme used in Caprica's opening. Neat!

 

Also, check this out (New BSG theme redone so you can hear the prayers): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZclLpczKhJg&NR=1

 

There's more depth to these series than just what's in the scripts or on the screen...
