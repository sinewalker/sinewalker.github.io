Here is the music theme to the "Caprica" TV series:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gMCNuZANVo

 

Now, here is the Original Battlestar Galactica movie theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjbvcZi_nXA&playnext=1&list=PLA9DA08CE43879E53

 

Check out about 2.5 to 3 minutes in, after the fanfare and Colonail anthem, the line that the oboe plays is that used for Caprica, neat!

 

Also, check this out (New BSG theme redone so you can hear the prayers): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZclLpczKhJg&NR=1

 

There's more depth to these series than just what's in the scripts...
