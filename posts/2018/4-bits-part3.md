Here is the forth part of my [blog series](/tags/4-bit-rules.html) expanding on my
[4-bit rules of computing](/pg/4-bit-rules.html).

[Previously](/blog/2015/4-bit-rules-of-computing-part-2.html): Mike was reflecting on comments, both in source code and in social media, and had come to the conclusion that they are to be avoided, that they can be more harmful than helpful, and that source code (and people) should be allowed to speak for itself.

There is an exception to Rule 5 (Rule 0 allows for this): **doc-comments**.   Here he explores what they are, how they differ from regular comments, and how to use them to assist your fellow hackers.

**Rule 6**: Doc-comments are a Force for Good

(follows on from Rule 5 *Comments considered harmful*)
