I'm taking my notes in [Jupyter](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) while I explore the Minecraft API and poke around with one of the sample programs.  Since by blogging engine [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/) also supports Jupyter Notebooks as one of it's import formats, I found that I could do [Litterate Programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com/) for Minecraft quite nicely!\n",
