```
Well, I'd like to visit the moon
On a rocket ship high in the air
Yes, I'd like to visit the moon
But I don't think I'd like to live there

  Though I'd like to look down at the earth from above
  I would miss all the places and people I love
  So although I might like it for one afternoon
  I don't want to live on the moon

 

I'd like to travel under the sea
I could meet all the fish everywhere
Yes, I'd travel under the sea
But I don't think I'd like to live there

  I might stay for a day there if I had my wish
  But there's not much to do when your friends are all fish
  And an oyster and clam aren't real family
  So I don't want to live in the sea



    I'd like to visit the jungle, hear the lions roar
    Go back in time and meet a dinosaur
    There's so many strange places I'd like to be
    But none of them permanently

 

So if I should visit the moon
I would dance on a moonbeam and then
I would make a wish on a star
And I'll wish I was home once again

  Though I'd like to look down at the earth from above
  I would miss all the places and people I love
  So although I may go I'll be coming home soon
  'Cause I don't want to live on the moon
  No, I don't want to live on the moon
```
