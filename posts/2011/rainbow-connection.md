I'm learning a new song to sing to my kids at bedtime

<!-- TEASER_END -->
----

Why are there so many songs about rainbows

  and what's on the other side?

Rainbows aren't visions, but only illusions

  and rainbows have nothing to hide.

So we've been told and some choose to believe it

  I know they're wrong wait and see.

Someday we'll find it, the Rainbow Connection

  the lovers, the dreamers and me.

 

Who said that every wish would be heard and answered

  when wished on the morning star?

Somebody thought of that and someone believed it

  look what it's done so far.

What's so amazing that keeps us star gazing

  and what do we think we might see?

Someday we'll find it, the Rainbow Connection

  the lovers, the dreamers and me.

 

All of us under it's spell we know that it's probably magic.

 

Have you been half asleep and have you heard voices?

  I've heard them calling my name.

Is this the sweet sound that called the young sailors?

  The voice might be one and the same.

I've heard it too many times to ignore it

  it's something that I'm s'posed to be. [see?]

Someday we'll find it, the Rainbow Connection

  the lovers, the dreamers and me.

 

La-da-da de-da-da doom

  ba da da-da la-de da doom.

 

-- Kermit the Frog, the Muppet Movie.  Transcribed by me.

 

[I think Kermit sings "s'posed to be", but "see" would fit the poetry better, so maybe I'm wrong?]
