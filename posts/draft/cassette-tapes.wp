<html><body><p>Do you remember <a title="Compact Cassette (Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Cassette">cassette tapes</a>? We've still got a few favorites lying around the house or at my parents' place.  There are a couple we used to play a lot as kids that would be fun to play with my own kids now.  Trouble is, we only have one cassette player in the house.  It'd be nice to take them for long car trips and so on, but we have this new-fangled CD player that only plays CDs and MP3s :)


Tapes are a thing of the past, but there's no reason to miss out on playing your old favorites — just convert them into more modern formats and enjoy them again.  Here's the process I follow to convert tapes using <a title="Audcacious!" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>.

For this example, I'm using <em>Funbusters, </em>which is a two-volume set produced by J&amp;B Records.  It contains a bunch of silly songs for kids.  Unfortunately J&amp;B did not print the production or copyright dates on the cover, only their catalog number: JB 217C.  If you're curious about copyright infringement, in Australia at least the <a title="Copyright Amendment 2006, schedule 6" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/caa2006213/sch6.html">2006 amendment to section 109A</a> of the <a title="Australian Copyright Act 1968" href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/">Copyright Act of 1968</a> allows one to format-shift audio recordings, so long as it is for private and domestic use. Bewdy.

</p><h2>Overview</h2>

Broadly, this project proceeds as follows

<ol>
	<li>Record both sides of the tape, in full, to your computer</li>
	<li>Clean up to remove tape noise</li>
	<li>Cut out individual songs as needed and save to <a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV_file">WAV</a> files (these will become separate tracks on a CD)</li>
	<li>Record the WAV files to an <a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc">audio CD</a>, or convert to other formats like <a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg">Ogg</a> <a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis">Vorbis</a> or <a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3">MP3</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>What you need</h2>

<ul>
	<li>A cassette player with headphone or line-out jack.  Preferably 3.5mm stereo</li>
	<li>A cassette tape to copy.  It should be one that you own...</li>
	<li>A computer with audio–in.  Hopefully 3.5mm stereo again. <em>Note</em>:— if your computer has both "Line–in" and "Mic", try the Line–in jack, because some Microphone inputs are monaural, not stereo.  The computer should also have speakers attached so you can monitor what you're doing</li>
	<li>A length of 3.5mm–3.5mm stereo lead (to match your cassette player and computer).  You can make your own out of old headphone leads, or just buy one, they're pretty cheap. Try <a title="Dick Smith Electronics — seach for 3.5mm stereo lead" href="http://search.dse.com.au/search?w=3.5mm+stereo+plug+to+3.5mm+stereo+plug&amp;asug=3.5mm+ster&amp;sessionid=4c33cb5b0169da8c2744c0a87e0106a8&amp;ts=new">Dodgy Dick's</a>, <a title="J&amp;B Hi Fi search — this product probably not my first choice on price" href="https://www.jbhifionline.com.au/ipod-mp3-portables/accessories/belkin-f8v203-06gld-ap-mini-stereo-cable-for-ipod-and-iphone/238507">J&amp;B Hi-Fi</a>, <a title="Google search" href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=ebay+3.5mm+to+3.5mm+stereo+lead">Ebay</a> an so on</li>
	<li>A copy of Audacity to suit your computer. It's available for <a title="Download Audacity for Linux" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/linux">Linux</a>, <a title="Download Audacity for your Mac" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/mac">Macintosh</a>, even <a title="Download Audacity for Windows" href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/windows">Windows</a>.</li>
	<li>Time.  To copy a 60 minute tape into your computer, it will take 60 minutes. Then after that you need to clean it up and master a new format as well</li>
	<li>Enough free hard-drive space — about 5GB should do.
Recording a whole tape at double CD quality (32-bits)  works out to about 20 megabytes a minute. For the record, my <em>Funbusters</em> tapes took about 2GB to record raw, <em>but that's not all! </em>You'll also want a bit more space to work in,  say roughly half as much again. If you're going to master a CD for use in a car, you'll want a further 600-800MB for the final WAV files and maybe some space to stage the recording image before it's written to the disc.</li>

</ul>

Obviously if your player or your computer don't have 3.5mm stereo jacks, you'll need to get or make a lead to suit. I'm not going to explain that.  If your player is only monaural instead of stereo, everything will be on the Left channel once it reaches the computer.  You can investigate how to clone the Left channel to the Right on your own, it's pretty easy. Or see if you can get a newer tape player :)

<h2>Setting up</h2>

Just in case someone reads this who has never used a tape player, or hasn't dug theirs out of the cupboard for years, I thought I'd add this in.

<ol>
	<li>Connect your tape player to it's power source per normal (wall socket, batteries, whatever)</li>
	<li>Connect the 3.5mm lead between the player and the computer, by plugging one end into the player's headphones jack, and the other into the computer's "Line-in" or "Audio-in" jack</li>
	<li>Insert the cassette with Side 1/A facing out, cue it to the beginning by rewinding all the way with the button marked "REW" or "&lt;&lt;". <strong>Caution: </strong>most players <em>do not </em>stop the drive motor when they reach the end of the tape, so keep and ear out for a change in motor noise, to avoid stretching the tape!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuring Audacity</h2>

Start Audacity and make sure it is set to record in Stereo, and with good quality. You can access this dialog from Audacity's Edit menu, under "Preferences...". This is also where you tell it to record from the computer's "Line-in" rather than it's built-in mic or some such. Details for that differ depending on what kind of computer you have. For my Linux box it worked right without fiddling:

<h2>Setting Levels</h2>

The first thing to do is to set your player's "Volume" to a level such that the signal is loud and clear, without it being <a title="Audio clipping" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_%28audio%29">clipped</a> by your computer's <a title="Digital to Analogue Converter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter">DAC</a>.  It's important to do this because cassette tapes have an inherent problem with noise (one of the advantages of CDs over cheap tape players). We want to boost the signal as much as we can to compensate.  Turning up the "Volume" also boosts the noise, but we will fix that after we get the music into the computer.



This is a process of trial and error and takes a while. The good news is, once your have found the right level for your player, you can just put a mark on the dial and not have to do this again.



If your player has a radio, use that — especially useful are commercial radio stations, because they <a title="(Wikipedia)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companding">compand</a> their ads to make them seem as loud and clear as possible. Detuning the radio to pick up some <a title="Radio static" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_%28radio%29">static</a> with a lot of  white noise also works well, because the sound coming out is fairly constant and maximum (although you'll have to watch the VU metres for clipping since you can't hear it). If your player doesn't have a radio, you should find a loud section of the tape recording to use, and test with that.

<h3>Here's what to do</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Fire up your computer and start Audacity (follow the instructions that come with the software)</li>
	<li>Press "PLAY" or "&gt;" on the tape player, or turn it over to the Radio mode</li>
	<li>Press Audacity's Record button (a pinkish red circle).
You should hear the radio programme or the tape music coming through the computer's speakers and see some red level meters bouncing in time with the music.</li>
	<li>Adjust the volume on the tape player so that the level meters peak just below the maximum mark. This takes patience so just keep at it.
You can also adjust the recording level in the computer using a  slider in Audacity with an icon that looks like a microphone. I don't usually touch that because it gets too fiddly to keep both volumes in the right place, but you might like to boost it up if everything's very quiet even when the tape player is turned right up to max</li>
	<li>When you are happy with the sound levels, press Audacity's yellow Stop button and then stop the tape player.</li>
	<li>Mark the level on the player, or write down the number — you'll hopefully never have to do this again for other tapes. If you had to adjust the recording level in Audacity, write down what you set it to</li>
	<li>Close Audacity, don't save the project</li>
</ol>

<h2>Digitize the cassette tape</h2>

First, set your equipment up as just described. I like to queue the tape to the beginning of the first side, don't bother to wind past the lead-in, that'll be useful for a noise base later.



Check the tape to see if it has any defects. If the tape is lightly <a title="What's cinching" href="http://cool.conservation-us.org/byorg/bavc/bavcterm.html#cinching">cinched</a>, (can happen when a cassette has been jostled about a lot) wind it completely forwards and backwards a couple of times to take the fold it out, otherwise you'll get wa-wa sounds, or worse the tape will catch in the player's mechanics and get completely folded or chewed.



When recording a tape on the computer I usually record Side 1/A as one project and then Side 2/B as another. If your player as an "auto-reverse" then that's fine too, but I usually don't use it because the noise on the tape varies over the recording anyway.



So once you're set up, hit "PLAY" or "&gt;" on the tape player and then Audacity's Record button (pinking red circle) and let it record record the whole side. Once that's done, turn the tape over, start a new project and record again. You now have two projects, one for each side of the tape. It's time to clean them up

<h2>Cleaning up the recordings</h2>

Audacity has a lot of impressive filters and other effects you can apply to recordings (such as slowing tempo without adjusting pitch, or vice-versa).  One of the most useful is the noise filter, which nicely removes constant hiss and hum produced by a tape player.



The filter works by first collecting a base noise level, and then subtracting that noise from selected parts of the recording.  Consiquently you use it in two phases



First:  select some noise from the tape that doesn't have any music.  The lead-in at the beginning of the tape is great for this, or else the "silence" between songs, if there is any.  Select a blank section and choose</body></html>
