This is the original version from the 1980s/1990s.  It's difficult to find it online today, and definitely ***not***, the hack-job that Homer butchered on The Simpsons...

 

Dos Equis, a Mexican beer

Ray, the man I buy it from

Me, a guy, I buy beer for

Far, a long way to the bar

So, I think I'll have a beer

La, lalalalalala!

Tea?

No thanks, I'll have a beer

And that brings us back to....
